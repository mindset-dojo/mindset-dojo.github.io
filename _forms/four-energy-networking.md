excerpt: "A simple, relational practice for understanding how energy moves through people and the domains they serve — so that individuals and communities can collaborate with greater clarity, coherence, and care."
---

## Intention

Four Energy Networking is a way for people to understand one another through the lens of the Four Energies (FEBI™ - Focus Energy Balance Indicator) and the domains they move in. It opens a space where I can share not only who I am, but how energy moves through my work, my challenges, and my opportunities — so that I can connect with others more skillfully and be seen more clearly.

At the same time, it reveals how our domains relate, intersect, or differ — so that the community can understand its collective landscape, recognize where gaps or tensions lie, and discover where natural alliances or support can emerge.

This form creates a simple structure for seeing ourselves and each other as part of a larger field of relationships.

## Experience

Participants arrive having completed a basic FEBI™ assessment and a short reflection. They bring their report as a reference point, not a label.

The session begins with a brief warm-up such as [Four Energy Sensei](../four-energy-sensei/), helping everyone settle and sense into their own energy before connecting with others.

From there, the group rotates through short conversations in dyads or triads. In each round, people share their energy tendencies, their primary domain of practice or influence, and what they are noticing in that domain. Over a few rounds, patterns, tensions, and possibilities begin to surface.

When the group returns to a full circle, the collective picture becomes clearer: how energy is moving across the community, where support is needed, and what opportunities are emerging.

## Implementation

**Prerequisite:** Each participant brings their FEBI™ report (or page 5 summary).

### Steps

1. **Warm-up (optional):**  
   Use [Four Energy Sensei](../four-energy-sensei) as a full-group opener.

2. **Rotating Dyads/Triads:**  
   Move through 3–5 short rounds of conversation.

3. **Personal + Domain Sharing:**  
   In each round, participants briefly share:
   - personal energy tendencies  
   - the domain they work in or care about  
   - what they are noticing in that domain  
   - gaps or tensions they perceive  
   - opportunities or openings they sense

4. **Field Awareness:**  
   Notice recurring themes or resonances across the rotations.

5. **Whole-Group Harvest:**  
   As a group, reflect on:
   - What did we learn about each other?
   - What did we learn about our domains?
   - What gaps or opportunities showed up repeatedly?
   - Where is support or collaboration naturally emerging?

6. **Optional Follow-Up:**  
   - collaboration conversations  
   - peer or small-group clusters  
   - coaching  
   - continued field sensing

### What I gain

- A clearer sense of my own energy tendencies  
- A better understanding of how others experience me  
- Insight into the energy dynamics of my domain  
- Language for describing gaps, tensions, and opportunities  
- New relationships and potential collaborators

### What the community gains

- A shared picture of who is here and what domains we represent  
- Visibility into system-wide gaps and opportunities  
- Early signals of natural alliances and support structures  
- A more coherent, flexible network  
- A foundation for collective action or deeper practice

Four Energy Networking strengthens the field by helping us sense our worlds — and each other — more clearly.
