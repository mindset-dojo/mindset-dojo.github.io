## Intention

Sitting Meditation is a foundational stillness practice that unifies breath, posture, and attention into a steady state of presence. It strengthens emotional regulation, increases impulse control, and builds the internal stability needed for the training game. The practice is simple to begin, yet deep enough to refine for a lifetime.

## Experience

At first, the mind resists stillness. Thoughts surface. Narratives form. The urge to adjust or escape grows. Instead of reacting, you learn to **stay**, to return to breath and posture, to meet each impulse with clarity instead of collapse.  

Over time, small openings appear: a softer inhale, a steadier spine, a moment where your awareness widens and the pressure inside quiets. You begin to experience a subtle freedom anchored in your own presence.

## Implementation

1. **Posture**: Sit on a chair or cushion. If sitting on the floor, support your legs with padding so your hips rest above your knees. Keep your spine naturally upright—balanced, not rigid—so your breath can move freely from your center.

2. **Hands**: Rest your hands lightly in a simple fold at the lower abdomen. The point is comfort and stability, not formality.

3. **Eyes**: Keep your gaze soft, gently lowered or half-lidded. See the whole field in front of you without focusing sharply on any single point.

4. **Breath**: Breathe from your center (lower belly), allowing the breath to rise and fall without force. Count each exhale up to 10, then reset. When the mind wanders—as it will—simply return to 1 without judgment.

5. **Stillness**: The core of the practice is not moving. Let discomfort be information, not instruction. Prepare yourself—water, bathroom, posture—so you can stay for the full duration.

6. **Timing**: Begin with **5 minutes** a day. Increase by 5-minute increments as the practice stabilizes. Work toward **30 minutes** as a longer-form immersion.

Sitting Meditation develops the internal stability required for coherence in motion—on the mat, in dialogue, and under pressure. It can be trained anywhere: solo, with a partner, in triads, or in groups, whether virtual or in-person.
