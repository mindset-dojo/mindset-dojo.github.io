## Intention

High Presence Networking is the practice of bringing your embodied awareness into real communities — places where energy, dialogue, and collaboration are alive. It’s how we extend dojo training into the social field.  

The purpose isn’t to “network” in the conventional sense, but to *connect through coherence.* To listen deeply. To contribute presence instead of performance. And to practice resonance in motion — where ideas, people, and systems meet.  

This form supports integrating your training into authentic, high-contact communities — professional, creative, contemplative, or technical — where your energy can be tested, refined, and expanded through real participation.

## Experience

Choose a community that matters to you — one that challenges and expands you, not just one that mirrors you. It should be a living field, not a content feed.  

Here are a few examples of high-presence communities:

- [Zen Leadership: Off the Cushion](https://zenleader.global/events) — where embodiment and leadership intersect in practice.  
- [Chosei Zen](https://www.choseizen.org/) — a community devoted to integrating Zen, science, and leadership.  
- [Japanese Culture Center / Tenshinkan Dojo](https://japaneseculturecenter.com/classes/aikido) — physical and spiritual training in the art of Aikido.  
- [InnerSource Commons Foundation](https://innersourcecommons.org/) — an open source community cultivating collaboration within organizations.  
- [Fearless Change](https://www.fearlesschangepatterns.com/) — a global pattern language community focused on culture, change, and human connection.  
- [Cloud Security Office Hours](https://csoh.org/) — where technology and humanity meet through inquiry and shared intelligence.  

Enter these spaces as training environments. Notice your energy as you participate — where you contract, where you flow, where you overgive or withdraw. Practice *relaxing completely, centering with intention, meeting fear with presence,* and allowing *playful resonance* to guide your interactions.  

This is the fieldwork of dojo presence — where awareness meets community in real time.

## Implementation

### Steps

1. **Choose with Intention**  
  Pick a community that aligns with your growth edge—professional, creative, or contemplative—and commit to showing up regularly for a while.

1. **Enter as a Practice**  
  Before joining a session or discussion, take [One Breath](../one-breath/) to center. Let go of the need to perform or impress. Arrive to listen and blend.

1. **Engage through Resonance**  
  Relax completly, center with intention, and ...
    - Notice when you’re reacting or rehearsing.  
    - Redirect attention to the field and its shared rhythm.  
    - Contribute with clarity, curiosity, and care.

1. **Reflect Afterwards**  
  Commit the following to internalize and align learning:
    - Pause for a short [Stillness Contemplation](../stillness-contemplation/).  
    - Ask:  
        - *What energy did I bring?*  
        - *What energy did I receive?*  
    - Capture insights for your next Self-Authorship [Circle](../circle/) or [Mat](../mat/) session.

1. **Return and Refine**  
  Each encounter is an opportunity to test your training under real social pressure. The more you bring presence into the field, the more the field reflects coherence back to you.
