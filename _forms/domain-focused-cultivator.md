## Intention

A Domain-Focused Cultivator supports [the Dojo](../dojo/) through their domain expertise tuned in through the Program. They show up to Cultivator [Circle](../circle/) meetings regularly, and volunteer their experience in a mutually beneficial way. They are at least Green Level, and vouched for by existing Cultivators.  

## Experience

You train to apply the Program to your chosen domain of expertise. You meet regularly with other Cultivators to work on projects, learn from mentors, and ensure that [the Dojo](../dojo/) is well-maintained. You give what makes sense above the basic responsibilities to maintain the designation, and receive what makes sense in return. In short, you get back what you put in.

As you work within your domain, you'll begin noticing how clarity, alignment, and movement arise from shared action rather than debate, and how transparency lightens even complex efforts. Domain cultivation becomes a living expression of responsiveness.

## Implementation

After clearing the Grey Level [Threshold](../threshold/), make a significant contribution to the community in your chosen domain. Network with other Cultivators, express your interest in the designation and mentorship, and start attending Cultivator [Circle](../circle/) meetings. Train hard in both the Program and your chosen domain, make contributions as it makes sense, and get to Green Level. Once you pass the Green Level [Threshold](../threshold/), negotiate sponsorship from existing Cultivators and then make a pull request claiming the designation.

As you cultivate your domain, let your work be guided the following principles:  
- **Nothing Hidden, Nothing Forced** — share what you see and intend so momentum can align without pressure.  
- **Alignment Comes From Action** — contribute early and lightly; each step reveals the domain’s true shape.  
- **Presence Over Process** — respond to what’s happening now rather than clinging to a plan.  
- **Movement Creates the Path** — keep the domain light and alive; let motion clarify what’s needed.

Held lightly, these principles help your domain evolve naturally, without heaviness or friction.
