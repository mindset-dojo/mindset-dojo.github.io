## Intention

A Domain-Focused Cultivator engages with [the Dojo](../dojo/) through their domain expertise, participating as their focus, energy, and context allow. They are at least Green Level, and vouched for by existing Cultivators. They show up to Cultivator [Circle](../circle/) meetings regularly, and volunteer their experience in a mutually beneficial way during the phase. Designation is continuously re-evaluated based on active contribution and engagement rather than fixed thresholds. Cultivators may move in and out of phases of participation while maintaining alignment with the Dojo’s goals.

## Experience

You train and contribute to your chosen domain while participating in Cultivator Circles and mentoring relationships. Contributions are recognized proportionally: the more present and aligned your action, the more your designation is affirmed. Your impact is measured by shared progress, not by a permanent title.

As you work within your domain, you'll begin noticing how clarity, alignment, and movement arise from shared action rather than debate, and how transparency lightens even complex efforts. Domain cultivation becomes a living expression of responsiveness.

## Implementation

To enter the Domain-Focused Cultivator phase:

- Engage with a project or Circle and express your intent to contribute after you pass the Green Level [Threshold](../threshold/).
- Contributions are ongoing; your designation is maintained through demonstrated alignment, impact, and active collaboration.
- Engagement is naturally flexible: if you step back or focus elsewhere, the designation reflects your current level of active participation rather than removing recognition entirely.
- Re-evaluation is continuous: peers and mentors observe contributions and affirm the designation as engagement persists.

As you cultivate your domain, let your work be guided the following principles:  

- **Nothing Hidden, Nothing Forced** — share what you see and intend so momentum can align without pressure.  
- **Alignment Comes From Action** — contribute early and lightly; each step reveals the domain’s true shape.  
- **Presence Over Process** — respond to what’s happening now rather than clinging to a plan.  
- **Movement Creates the Path** — keep the domain light and alive; let motion clarify what’s needed.

Held lightly, these principles help your domain evolve naturally, without heaviness or friction.
