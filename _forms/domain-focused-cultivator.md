## Intention

A Domain-Focused Cultivator supports [the Dojo](../dojo/) through their domain expertise tuned in through the Program. They show up to Cultivator [Circle](../circle/) meetings regularly, and volunteer their experience in a mutually beneficial way. They are at least Green Level, and vouched for by existing Cultivators.  

## Experience

You train to apply the Program to your chosen domain of expertise. You meet regularly with other Cultivators to work on projects, learn from mentors, and ensure that [the Dojo](../dojo/) is well-maintained. You give what makes sense above the basic responsiblities to maintain the designation, and receive what makes sense in return. In short, you get back what you put in.

## Implementation

After passing the Grey Level [Threshold](../threshold/), make a significant contribution to the community in your chosen domain. Network with the other Cultivators, express your interest in the designation and mentorship, and start attending Cultivator [Circle](../circle/) meetings. Train hard in both the Program and your chosen domain, make contributions as it makes sense, and get to Green Level. Once you pass the Green Level [Threshold](../threshold/), negotiate sponsorship from existing Cultivators and then make a pull request claiming the designation.
