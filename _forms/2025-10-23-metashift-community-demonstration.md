excerpt: "A higher-level dojo form for demonstrating presence within another community — embodying Mindset Dojo principles through participation and shared practice."
---

## Intention

To **demonstrate presence under invitation** — embodying dojo principles within another community or lineage without relying on explanation or persuasion.  
The aim is to bridge dojos and disciplines through mutual recognition, allowing presence itself to transmit practice.

This form represents a higher-level expression of leadership: an act of **networking through demonstration**, where teaching, authorship, and relational resonance converge.

## Experience

A host community invites a Mindset Dojo pair to lead or present.  
The **Primary Presenter** sets tone, context, and energetic direction.  
The **Supporting Presenter** stabilizes the field, seeds dialogue, and facilitates one breakout group or reflection circle.

A typical session unfolds as follows:

**Grounding & Opening** – The host centers the conversation in ways that make sense for their community, establishing mutual presence.  

**Context Setting** – The dojo team acknowledges shared intentions and bridges vocabulary with the host community’s culture.  

**Demonstration** – Three to five dojo forms are introduced or embodied (e.g., [Circle](../circle/), [Mat](../mat/), [Zensei](../zensei/), [Zenpai](../zenpai/), [Four Element Zensei](../four-element-zensei/), [Three Question Reflection](../three-question-reflection/)).  

**Participation** – Attendees are invited to “step onto the mat,” moving fluidly between witnessing and engaging.  

**Breakout Practice** – Smaller group exercises deepen embodied understanding.  

**Integration & Reflection** – *Dynamic Silence* and *Wisdom of the Crowd* practices harvest collective insight.

## Implementation

When a practitioner reaches a high enough level of skill and confidence to represent the dojo publicly, they are encouraged to connect with their [Zenpai](../zenpai/) and [Zensei](../zensei/) to co-develop a preparation strategy. This preparation phase focuses on understanding the host community’s culture, mapping shared intentions, and clarifying which forms to demonstrate. Together, they establish the networking and logistical plan necessary to ensure the event flows with both spontaneity and structure. Preparation should include rehearsal of the opening and closing rhythms, alignment on contextual language, and clarity on how the **Primary** and **Supporting Presenter** will exchange leadership during the session.

After the demonstration, reflection and integration begin immediately. The presenters document key insights, compose a brief **Insight Article** within a few days, and express gratitude to the host community — a practice formalized through the [Genuine Gratitude Expression](../genuine-gratitude-expression/) form. Any new or evolved training patterns, such as [Integration Under Fire](../integration-under-fire/), are then contributed back into the training **Form Library**, completing the learning loop from demonstration to authorship.
