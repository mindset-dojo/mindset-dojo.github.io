## Intention

Inspired by the Negotiation 9 Moves by Black Swan Group, the PSP (Probe, Silence, Paraphrase) Cycle is a unit of and the process to obtain integrative conversation. Through shifting from Visionary-Driver (Probe) to Visionary-Collaborator (Silence) to Collaborator-Organizer (Paraphrase) stances continuously, well used [Tone](../tone/) and inviting one's conversational partner to do the same, one invites the formation of [Meta](../meta/) energy, raising one's position on the Map of Consciousness and ensuring a Plus Ki (energy flow) orientation.

## Experience

You are curious and present in the conversation, inviting your conversational partner to match your [Stance](../stance/). You are considerate of the other, doing [Two Sides](../two-sides/) as needed, giving them the space and consideration they deserve. In doing so, the probability of having a conversation that matters at a high position on the Map of Consciousness increases.

## Implementation

First, you Probe (what the Negotiation 9 Moves calls a Calibrated Question) your conversational partner about something of interest. Use open-ended What or How questions generally, and only use Why to make a weakly convinced person convince themselves about the merit of your proposal. Then, after the Probe, leave room for Silence (what the Negotiation 9 Moves calls Dynamic Silence). This silence is a pregnant silence, full of possiblity screaming to be fulfilled. When your conversational partner fills the conversational vaccum with the answer to your question, Paraphrase (Also Paraphrase in Negotiation 9 Moves) their answer in your own words. This shows them that you have internalized and connected with what they are saying, inviting them to do the same. Then your conversational partner might Probe you in return, and the Cycle begins again. Try to repeat the Cycle until mutual understanding and alignment has been reached. Skillful and appropriate use of [Tone](../tone/), and [Stances](../stances/) is Ki (energy flow) in ensuring successful execution of the PSP Cycle.
