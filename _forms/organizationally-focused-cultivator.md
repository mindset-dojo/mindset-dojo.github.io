## Intention

An Organizationally-Focused Cultivator supports the community through their deep knowledge of the Program, [the Dojo](../dojo/), and The Way. They guide, harmonize, and model training authorship, lead Cultivator [Circle](../circle/) meetings regularly, and cultivate community culture and brand coherence. They have passed the Black Level [Threshold](../threshold/), and gained existing Cultivators’ endorsement.

## Experience

You aid the organization and community holistically through mastery of what is taught in the Program and beyond. You work to not merely refine processes, but presence itself. You mentor aspiring and existing Domain-Focused Cultivators. You also align the practices of [the Dojo](../dojo/) with The Way.

In this role, you increasingly sense the architecture behind the forms—how they emerge, how they guide others, and how they remain alive over time. Organizational cultivation is as much stewardship of form-shaping as it is stewardship of people.

## Implementation

As a Domain-Focused Cultivator, keep making contributions, networking, and training in the Program. Once you pass the Black Level [Threshold](../threshold/), negotiate with other Cultivators for sponsorship. Once you receive it, make a pull request claiming the Organizationally-Focused Cultivator designation.

As you step into shaping the dojo at an architectural level, let your work be grounded in the following principles:
- **Focus on One Point** — design and refine from a single intention, returning whenever the form drifts.  
- **Give the Learner the Pen** — create openings for others to step in, discover, and author their own growth.  
- **Let Experience Do the Writing** — include only what has been embodied in real practice, not imagined from theory.  
- **Shape Lightly** — keep forms simple, human, and alive so they remain easy to use and easy to evolve.

These principles help keep the dojo’s culture coherent while allowing creativity, clarity, and contribution to flow naturally through the community.
