## Intention

An Organizationally-Focused Cultivator supports the community through their deep knowledge of the Program, [the Dojo](../dojo/), and The Way. They guide, harmonize, and model training authorship, lead Cultivator [Circle](../circle/) meetings, and cultivate community culture and brand coherence. They have passed the Black Level [Threshold](../threshold/), and gained existing Cultivators’ endorsement.

Designation is **phase-based and dynamic**: it reflects current engagement, alignment, and contribution rather than permanent status. While this role carries higher responsibility and requires active presence, participation naturally ebbs and flows in response to the needs of the Dojo and the capacity of the Cultivator. Existing Cultivators endorse participation and help maintain alignment with community standards.

## Experience

You contribute holistically to the organization and community through mastery of what is taught in the Program and beyond. You work to refine not just processes but presence itself. You mentor aspiring and existing Domain-Focused Cultivators and help ensure that [the Dojo](../dojo/) practices remain aligned with The Way.  

Organizational cultivation emphasizes **stewardship over form and community**, noticing how practices emerge, evolve, and sustain coherence over time. Recognition of your designation is maintained through demonstrated impact, visible alignment, and thoughtful engagement.

## Implementation

- Enter the Organizationally-Focused phase by actively contributing, mentoring, and guiding the Dojo at an architectural level while being a Domain-Focused Contributor. Live in that future Self as you work towards passing the Black Level [Threshold](../threshold) and gaining other cultivators' sponsorship to make that designation official.  
- Your designation is **continuously affirmed** through contributions and peer observation. If engagement naturally decreases, designation reflects current activity without punitive loss; re-engagement restores affirmation.  
- Maintain high responsibility by actively shaping culture, mentoring others, and safeguarding The Way.  
- Continue training and applying the Program and architectural understanding of the Dojo. Mentorship, facilitation, and community stewardship are the core measures of impact.  

As you cultivate organizational alignment, your work is guided by these Principles:

- **Focus on One Point** — design and refine from a single intention, returning whenever the form drifts.  
- **Give the Learner the Pen** — create openings for others to step in, discover, and author their own growth.  
- **Let Experience Do the Writing** — include only what has been embodied in real practice, not imagined from theory.  
- **Shape Lightly** — keep forms simple, human, and alive so they remain easy to use and easy to evolve.

These principles help keep the dojo’s culture coherent while allowing creativity, clarity, and contribution to flow naturally through the community.
