## Intention

A Organizationally-Focused Cultivator supports the community through their deep knowledge of the Program, [the Dojo](../dojo/), and The Way. They guide, harmonize, and model training authorship, lead Cultivator [Circle](../circle/) meetings regularly, and cultivate community culture and brand coherance. They have passed the Black Level [Threshold](../threshold/), and gained existing Cultivators' endorsement.

## Experience

You aid the organization and community holistically through mastery of what is taught in the Program and beyond. You work to not merely refine processes, but presence itself. You mentor aspiring and existing Domain-Focused Cultivators. You also align the practices of [the Dojo](../dojo/) with The Way.

## Implementation

As a Domain-Focused Cultivator, keep making contributions, networking, and training in the Program. Once you pass the Black Level [Threshold](../threshold/), negotiate with other Cultivators sponsorship. Once you get it, make a pull request claiming the Organizationally-Focused Cultivator designation.
