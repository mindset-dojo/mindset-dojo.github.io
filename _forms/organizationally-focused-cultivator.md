## Intention

A Organizationally-Focused Cultivator supports the community through their deep knowledge of the Program, the Dojo, and The Way. They guide, harmonize, and model training authorship, lead Cultivator Circle meetings regularly, and cultivate community culture and brand coherance. They have passed the Black Level threshold, have fully read Ki in Daily Life and written an Insight article about their understanding of the book and how it relates to the Program, went through a [Randori](../randori) with existing Cultivators concerning that article, and gained their endorsement.

## Experience

You aid the organization and community holistically through mastery of what is taught in the Program and beyond. You work to not merely refine processes, but presence itself. You mentor aspiring and existing Domain-Focused Cultivators. You also align the practices of the Dojo with The Way.

## Implementation

As a Domain-Focused Cultivator, keep making contributions, networking, and training in the Program. Once you pass the Black Level Threshold, read Ki in Daily Life by Koichi Tohei. That book is the Rosetta Stone to the Dojo and The Way. After reading it fully, write a book review as an Insight article containing your thoughts and any critiques of the book. Afterwards, invite the other Cultivators to set up a [Randori](../randori/) testing your understanding of the book in an Author [Circle](../circle/). If you succeed, then invite the other Cultivators to endorse you, if not, reread the book and train more to incorporate the Cultivators critques. Once you secure endorsement, then make the pull request claiming the designation.
