excerpt: "A cultivation practice for groups and communities to awaken relational intelligence, deepen connection, and surface patterns, gaps, and opportunities across domains."

## Intention

Networks grow wiser when their members share more than biographies or patterns. They deepen when people reveal how they see, sense, and experience themselves and their domains — the territories they move in, influence, and care about.

Cultivating the network means cultivating this shared field of awareness. It enables a group to perceive not only each person’s energy tendencies, but also the tendencies of the systems they touch — their organizations, professions, communities, and lines of work.

This form creates the conditions for that relational mapping. It helps a group recognize itself as a living field with gaps, edges, tensions, openings, and possibilities.

## Experience

Participants arrive having completed a basic FEBI™ assessment and a brief reflection. They bring their FEBI™ report — not as identity, but as a lens.

The session begins with a warm-up such as [Four Energy Sensei](../four-energy-sensei/), helping the group settle, attune, and open perception.

From there, participants rotate through dyads or triads. These small-group conversations create a simple structure for getting to know one another’s energy tendencies, key domains, and the dynamics at play within those domains. As people share what they notice in their own fields — patterns, gaps, coherence, tensions, and possibilities — each rotation adds another thread to the larger picture.

Over multiple rounds, the group begins to sense both the individuals present and the broader landscape they collectively represent. A felt map of domains, energies, and opportunities starts to take shape.

When the full group reconvenes, the conversation turns to what emerged across these rotations: recurring patterns, shared gaps, unexpected insights, and possibilities that only become visible when the network is viewed as a whole.

## Implementation

Prerequisite: Each participant brings their FEBI™ report (or page 5 summary).

Steps:

1. Warm-up (optional):  
   [Four Energy Sensei](../four-energy-sensei) as a full group or during early rotations.

2. Rotating Dyads/Triads:  
   Move through 3–5 rounds.

3. Personal + Domain Sharing:
   In each rotation, participants share:
   - personal energy tendencies  
   - passions and interests  
   - how energy behaves in their domain
   - edges, gaps, and tensions they notice in that domain  
   - opportunities or openings they sense  
   - what energizes or troubles their field

4. Field Awareness:  
   Notice resonances across domains — where energy aligns, diverges, or wants to move.

5. Whole-Group Harvest:  
   Gather the group to reflect:
   - What did the network reveal?  
   - What themes emerged across domains?  
   - What collective opportunities are visible now?  
   - What patterns appear at the meta-level?  
   - Where does the network want to grow or stabilize?

6. Optional Follow-Up:  
   - domain-based collaborations  
   - coaching  
   - peer clusters  
   - further sensing conversations

### Reflective Harvest

This practice helps a community:

- Understand who is present  
- See the domains they represent  
- Surface energy tendencies across those domains  
- Identify shared gaps, edges, tensions, and opportunities  
- Reveal openings for cross-domain support  
- Informally map natural energy coalitions
- Build a more adaptive, relational network  
- Move from isolated insight to collective awareness

This is network cultivation — awakening the wisdom that emerges when we sense our worlds *together*.
