excerpt: "A cultivation practice for groups and communities to awaken relational intelligence, deepen connection, and surface patterns, gaps, and opportunities across domains."

## Intention

Networks grow wiser when their members share more than biographies or patterns. They deepen when people reveal how they see, sense, and experience themselves and their domains — the territories they move in, influence, and care about.

Cultivating the network means cultivating this shared field of awareness. It enables a group to perceive not only each person’s energy tendencies, but also the tendencies of the systems they touch — their organizations, professions, communities, and lines of work.

This form creates the conditions for that relational mapping. It helps a group recognize itself as a living field with gaps, edges, tensions, openings, and possibilities.

## Experience

Every participant arrives having completed a basic FEBI™ assessment and brief reflection. They bring their FEBI report — not as identity, but as a lens.

The session begins with a warm-up, such as [Four Energy Sensei](../four-energy-sensei/), to open the body and attune perception.

Participants then rotate through dyads or triads. In each conversation, they share not only their personal FEBI™ tendencies and interests, but also:

- how energy moves in *their* domain
- what patterns they observe in the systems they’re part of
- where they experience coherence
- where they perceive edges or gaps
- where they sense opportunity or potential
- what tensions, challenges, or openings their domain is facing
- what kind of energy is needed next

In this way, each small group becomes a micro-network sensing node: learning about people and about the worlds they inhabit.

As rotations continue, a collective picture begins to form — a felt sense of the broader field.

When the full group reconvenes, the discussion naturally unfolds:

- What domains did we encounter?
- What patterns or gaps repeated across them?
- What unexpected opportunities surfaced?
- How do these domains resonate or challenge one another?
- What possibilities emerge when seen together?

Some in the group begin to sense a network of domains, not just individuals.

## Implementation

Prerequisite: Each participant brings their FEBI™ report (or page 5 summary).

Steps:

1. Warm-up (optional):  
   [Four Energy Sensei](../four-energy-sensei) as a full group or during early rotations.

2. Rotating Dyads/Triads:  
   Move through 3–5 rounds.

3. Personal + Domain Sharing:
   In each rotation, participants share:
   - personal energy tendencies  
   - passions and interests  
   - how energy behaves in their domain
   - edges, gaps, and tensions they notice in that domain  
   - opportunities or openings they sense  
   - what energizes or troubles their field

4. Field Awareness:  
   Notice resonances across domains — where energy aligns, diverges, or wants to move.

5. Whole-Group Harvest:  
   Gather the group to reflect:
   - What did the network reveal?  
   - What themes emerged across domains?  
   - What collective opportunities are visible now?  
   - What patterns appear at the meta-level?  
   - Where does the network want to grow or stabilize?

6. Optional Follow-Up:  
   - domain-based collaborations  
   - coaching  
   - peer clusters  
   - further sensing conversations

### Reflective Harvest

This practice helps a community:

- Understand who is present  
- See the domains they represent  
- Surface energy tendencies across those domains  
- Identify shared gaps, edges, tensions, and opportunities  
- Reveal openings for cross-domain support  
- Informally map natural energy coalitions
- Build a more adaptive, relational network  
- Move from isolated insight to collective awareness

This is network cultivation — awakening the wisdom that emerges when we sense our worlds *together*.
