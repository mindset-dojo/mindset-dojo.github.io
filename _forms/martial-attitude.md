## Intention

Martial Attitude is the continuous integration and deployment of awareness and action, cultivating fluid trust through presence. It interprets perceived malice through systems thinking, allowing one to engage with the hyperactive, seperated from the wider flow, energy from a higher level of consciousness without collapsing into that stagnant energy. It powers the [Mat](../mat/) and ensures the shadow work (integrating what one represses into awareness) leads to Fearless Leadership.

## Experience

Where first you perceive war, through connection and redirection of resonance, you transform that into a dance. By collapsing the internal hierarchy and connecting person to person, the underlying need to fight disappears in most instances. Where it doesn't, through seeing through the Other's eyes and thus collapsing the illusion of seperation between Self and Other, you have the knowledge of their priorities and thus their vulnerabiiities, which can be exploited, if necessary, to stop the harm they plan on doing and restore harmony.

## Implementation

Begin practicing through [Three Centers](https://vimeo.com/944672806/e099593826). Once Head, Heart, and Hara (Mind, Emotions, and Gut) are aligned, then do [Two Sides](https://vimeo.com/944663134/d4f1c4f333) to see through your own, their own, and the wider relationship field's points of view. Utilizing systems thinking i.e. Four Patterns and the Map of Consciousness, find mutual connection points and move towards mutually beneficial [Thresholds](../threshold/) through extending Ki (your energy flow) in the relational field and adjusting your own stance and resonance, fearlessly leading through example. In short, Presence is Ki.
