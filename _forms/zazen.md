## Intention

Zazen is a practice of sitting meditation combining breath, posture, and stillness into an artform. It allows one to improve their emotional regulation and impulse control through practice. It is simple enough to start, but takes a lot of practice to sustain for any significant period of time.

## Experience

You struggle to allow your mind to relax through focusing on breath, posture, and stillness. Formerly repressed thoughts float through your mind, and you send them back to the source. The urge to act grows, and you learn to ignore it. Eventually, you experience a feeling of freedom from earthly affairs during meditation.

## Implementation

First, you sit, either on a chair or cushion. Make sure that your legs are supported by a cushion if you sit on the floor. Then your back should be straight, your spine a vertical line, to ensure proper Ki (flow of energy) from the Hara (center of energy in lower abdomen). You use your right hand to gently cover and grip your left hand's thumb and use your left hand's fingers to cover the right hand's fingers. Place both hands next to the lower abdomen. Ensure your eyes have a soft look and are half-lidded, seeing 180 degrees yet focused vaguely on a point a few feet away from you. Then start breathing from the Hara, i.e. breath from your belly, not just your lungs. Count every breath until you reach 10, then restart. If your mind starts to wander, to create a narrative, then restart from 1. Above everything else, **don't move** during Zazen. Make sure to drink water and do what you need to do before you start. Start out doing just 5 minutes a day, then keep adding 5 minute increments when you feel comfortable with the old length of time until you reach 30 minutes a day.
