## Intention

Reflect in a [Mat](../mat/) session about your experiences through answering 3 calibrated questions for your assigned group. This will help distill what you are learning and improve inner alignment.

## Experience

You center with intention to meet fear with presence. After doing so, you relax completely due to the playful resonance of the group. Following this exercise is a good time to consider authoring an Insight post.

## Implementation

Find a willing [Circle](../circle/), engage the [Mat](../mat/), and begin the session. After checking in and centering, work through the three calibrated questions. Doing so allows the group to share their answers and to collectively learn.

## Inspiration

- [Socratic Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method)
