## Intention

Reflect about your experiences through answering three What and/or How questions either with a group or on your own through [Stillness Contemplation](../stillness-contemplation/). This will help distill what you are learning and improve inner alignment.

## Experience

Sometimes, you are joyful, sometimes you are disquieted from what emerges. Often, you feel a stuck point dissolve.

## Implementation

### Individual

You probe yourself deeply with open-ended questions, leaving space open for what answers may follow through mental silence. Then you listen to what emerges, without getting attached to any narratives that may come with it.

### Group

Find a willing [Circle](../circle/), engage the [Mat](../mat/), and begin the session. After checking in and centering, work through the three questions. Doing so allows the group to share their answers and to collectively learn.

### Post-Exercise

Following this exercise is a good time to consider authoring an Insight post about the results of the reflection. Getting the insight down while it is fresh in your mind is critical to maintaining energy flow (Ki).
