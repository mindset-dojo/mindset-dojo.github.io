## Intention

Part of the [Four Patterns](../four-patterns/) from Institute for Zen Leadership, Visionary (In Elemental [FEBI®](https://zenleader.global/resources/febi-assessment), it is also known as Air) energy expands one's awareness beyond their immediate context, attracting the future.

## Experience

### External  

You perceive what others cannot, acting beyond the immediate.

### Internal  

Visionary is born of the subconscious, feeling like air. Postively trending, you can both see the idea in your mind and form it into reality. Negatively trending, one gets stuck in the mind and avoids reality.

### Collective  

Visionary brings unity of action through collective meaning. Postively trending, purpose acts as a point of unity. Negatively trending, people chase a dream that will never come to fruition, a delusion.

### Meta Compass Directions

- **Flowing + Postively Trending:** Opens into clear intuition that illuminates possibility without losing grounding.
- **Flowing + Negatively Trending:** Expands into ungrounded fantasy, projection, or anxiety-driven storymaking.
- **Stagnant + Postively Trending:** Reaches for insight but disperses into fog, abstraction, or indecision.
- **Stagnant + Negatively Trending:** Contracts into dissociation, escapism, or anxious inner spirals detached from reality.

You should let thought flow thorugh you, accepting what makes sense and letting the rest pass through.

## Implementation

Practicing Visionary is attracting the future while being present Now.

### Implementing Our Principles

Release tension by taking [One Breath](../one-breath), and allow the [Driver](../driver/) and [Collaborator](../collaborator/) energy to blend in. Perceive things as they are, not as you want them to be, and feel where they want to go. Then **act**. Sense, not fantasize. Learn from fear, do not let it rule you. Let the future flow forth from resonance.

### In Conversation  

In conversation, Visionary changes one's perception of reality:

- Mirror back key words in an conversation to explore important points further
- Being silent after you say something holds space for the future to arrive  
- A soft, inviting [Tone](../tone/) lures in possibility.

When mature, Visionary is embodied through execution.
