## Intention

Part of the [4 Patterns](../four-patterns/) from Institute for Zen Leadership, Visionary energy is what allows one to see beyond their immediate context and thus attract the future.

## Experience

You are brainstorming to solve a problem (i.e. Driver-Visionary). You fail to solve the problem then, and decide to take a shower. During the shower, you figure out the solution to the problem (i.e. Visionary-Organizer).

## Implementation

You use Mirrors™ to show awareness and open up for further exploration, Dynamic Silence™ to maintain presence while leaving space open, and a grounded, calm [Tone](../tone/) to show that you are prepared for the future, no matter how it may turn out.
