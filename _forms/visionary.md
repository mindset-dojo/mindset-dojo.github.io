## Intention

Part of the [4 Patterns](../four-patterns/) from Institute for Zen Leadership, Visionary energy expands one's awareness beyond their immediate context, attracting the future.

## Experience

### External  

You perceive what others cannot, acting beyond the immediate.

### Internal  

Visionary is born of the subconscious, feeling like air. Above the line, you can both see the idea in your mind and form it into reality. Below the line, one gets stuck in the mind and avoids reality.

### Collective  

Visionary brings unity of action through collective meaning. Above the line, purpose acts as a point of unity. Below the line, people chase a dream that will never come to fruition, a delusion.

---

### Shadow & Variations  

Shadow – All talk, no walk. Hypocrisy personified.

Overactive – Exhaustion through overthinking with no follow through.  

Imploding – One gives up after facing reality.  

Disassociated – Descent into nihilism.

You should let thought flow thorugh you, accepting what makes sense and letting the rest pass through.

## Implementation

Practicing Visionary is attracting the future while being present now.

### Implementing Our Principles

Release tension by taking [One Breath](../one-breath), and allow the [Visionary](../visionary/) and [Collaborator](../collaborator/) energy to rush in. Use [Two Sides](../two-sides/) to perceive things as they are, not as you want them to be, and feel where they want to go. Then align your [Three Centers](../three-centers/) and act. Sense, not fantasize. Learn from fear, do not let it rule you. Let the future flow forth from resonance.

### In Conversation  

In conversation, Visionary changes one's perception of reality:

- Mirrors explore key points further
- Dynamic Silence holds space for the future to arrive  
- An soft, inviting [Tone] lures in possibility.

When mature, Visionary is embodied through execution.
