## Intention

A Stance is the personal expression of one's FEBI™ energy archetypes through breath, tone, timing, and attention in relation to a context (others in the interaction and shared energy field). In short, one's attitude during the moments that matter. Different people have different Stances, and Stances can be shifted. Apply both the Platnum and Golden Rules when shifting Stances.

## Experience

You resonate/vibe with the people in the group and overall field, truely present and connected with them. You then lead them by example through understanding their energy capabilities (learning as we go if less familiar) and inviting for mutually beneficial and well timed shifts.

## Implementation

You first feel your own and your conversational partners FEBI™ energies and positions on the Map of Consciousness. Then you internally label it. For example, a Organizer-Visionary blend of FEBI™ energy based in fear could be labeled a cynical Stance. Once you understand your own and your conversational partner's Stances, you adjust your own FEBI™ energy and position on the Map of Consciousness through Zero Sympathy Phasing, i.e. connecting with them without being consumed by their energy, so that you invite them to cross the [Threshold](../threshold/) and assume the Stance you want.
