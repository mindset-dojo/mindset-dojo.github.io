## Intention

A Stance is the personal expression of one's [FEBI®](https://zenleader.global/resources/febi-assessment) energy archetypes through breath, [Tone](../tone/), timing, and attention in relation to a context (others in the interaction and shared energy field). In short, one's attitude during the moments that matter. Different people have different Stances, and Stances can be shifted. Apply both the Platnum and Golden Rules when shifting Stances.

## Experience

You resonate/vibe with the people in the group and overall field, truely present and connected with them. You then lead them by example through understanding their energy capabilities (learning as we go if less familiar) and inviting for mutually beneficial and well timed shifts.

## Implementation

Guided by the Meta Compass in the [Tone Form](../tone/), recognize your own and your converational partner's FEBI energies. Then understand the pulse and trends of the conversation (not to mind read or impose, rather to have a context from which to calibrate from). Once you understand your own and your conversational partner's Stance tendencies, you adjust through connecting with them without being consumed by their energy, so that you introduce through invitation mutually beneficial and well timed [Thresholds](../threshold/).

In short, be the change you want to see, and invite others to follow.

### Stance Tips

To progress the conversation, ask What and How questions (Visionary-Driver), remain silent afterwards (Visionary-Collaborator), then paraphrase what your converational partner said (Collaborator-Organizer).

Show acknowledgement of what they are saying through verbal and nonverbal means (Collaborator-Visionary).

Mirror key words and phrases back at the conversational partner with an curious, empathetic [Tone](../tone/) (Collaborator-Visionary).

Label what you feel your conversational partner's underlying feelings are (Collaborator–Visionary).

Buffer 'You' statements with 'I' statements to take responsiblity for your subjective perception of the situation (Visionary–Organizer).

Invite commitment through very specific questions that seeking a cooperative No (Driver–Collaborator). An example would be, "Is meeting at 4:30 PM a bad time?". This invites the body to commit, instead of mere acquiescence of the mind.

To complete or clear up the conversation, summarize the conversation in structured form while reflecting their emotional reality (Organizer–Collaborator). If one is dealing with stuck points or edges in an conversation, start with [Two Sides](../two-sides/) (Collaborator–Organizer) and then do a [Three Question Reflection](../three-question-reflection/) (Visionary–Collaborator) with a curious, empathetic [Tone](../tone/) to invite dissolving those stuck points/edges. Remember, having no agreement is better than a unsatisfying agreement. This is because that unsatisfaction breeds resentment which moves the relationship below the line.
