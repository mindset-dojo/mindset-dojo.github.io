## Intention

A Stance is the personal expression of one's FEBI™ energy archetypes through breath, tone, timing, and attention in relation to a context (others in the interaction and shared energy field). In short, one's attitude during the moments that matter. Different people have different Stances, and Stances can be shifted. Apply both the Platnum and Golden Rules when shifting Stances.

## Experience

You resonate/vibe with the people in the group and overall field, truely present and connected with them. You then lead them by example through understanding their energy capabilities (learning as we go if less familiar) and inviting for mutually beneficial and well timed shifts.

## Implementation

You first label your own and your conversational partners FEBI™ energies and positions on the Map of Consciousness from your own perspective (not to mind read or impose, rather to have a context from which to calibrate from). Once you understand your own and your conversational partner's Stance tendencies, you adjust your own FEBI™ energy and position on the Map of Consciousness through connecting with them without being consumed by their energy, so that you introduce through invitation mutually beneficial and well timed [Thresholds](../threshold/). Sometimes this shift may be into Driver other times into Visionary for example, so it isn't always "soft" and "passive", but is harmonious by intention.

### Stance Transitions

Before the conversation, enter an Visionary-Driver Stance through making a list of all the terrible things someone could say about you, and address those fears during a conversation to confront them with presence.

Ask What and How questions to invite a Visionary-Driver Stance, remain silent afterwards to invite Visionary-Collaborator, then paraphrase what they said to move to a Collaborator-Organizer Stance.

To maintain a Collaborator-Visionary Stance, mirror key words and phrases back at the conversational partner with an curious [Tone](../tone/). You can also label what you feel your partner's underlying feelings are to invite this Stance.

To enter an Visionary-Organizer Stance and invite Collaborator, buffer 'You' statements with 'I' statements to take responsiblity for your subjective perception of the situation.

For a Collaborator-Driver Stance show ackowledgement of what they are saying through verbal and nonverbal means.

Invite a Driver-Collaborator Stance with No-Oriented Questions, questions that invite a response from the body.

To close off the conversation with an Organizer-Collaborator Stance, summarize the conversation through telling the entire story through their perspective.
