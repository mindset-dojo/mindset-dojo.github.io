## Intention

A Stance is the personal expression of one's FEBI™ energy archetypes through breath, tone, timing, and attention in relation to a context (others in the interaction and shared energy field). In short, one's attitude during the moments that matter. Different people have different Stances, and Stances can be shifted. Apply both the Platnum and Golden Rules when shifting Stances.

## Experience

You resonate/vibe with the people in the group and overall field, truely present and connected with them. You then lead them by example through understanding their energy capabilities (learning as we go if less familiar) and inviting for mutually beneficial and well timed shifts.

## Implementation

You start by doing [Three Centers](../three-centers/) to center with intention upon having an integrative conversation, despite any pressure you are under. Then you do a variation of [Two Sides](../two-sides/), labeling your own and your conversational partners' FEBI™ energies and positions on the Map of Consciousness from your own perspective (not to mind read or impose, rather to have a context from which to calibrate from). Once you understand your own and your conversational partner's Stance tendencies, you adjust your own FEBI™ energy and position on the Map of Consciousness through connecting with them without being consumed by their energy, so that you introduce through invitation mutually beneficial and well timed [Thresholds](../threshold/).

### Stance Transitions

Ask What and How questions to invite a Visionary-Driver Stance, remain silent afterwards to invite Visionary-Collaborator, then paraphrase what they said to move to a Collaborator-Organizer Stance.

If one is dealing with stuck points or edges in an conversation, start with [Two Sides](../two-sides/) and then do a [Three Question Reflection](../three-question-reflection/) with a curious, empathetic [Tone](../tone/) to invite dissolving them.

To maintain a Collaborator-Visionary Stance, mirror key words and phrases back at the conversational partner with an curious [Tone](../tone/). You can also label what you feel your partner's underlying feelings are to invite this Stance.

To enter an Visionary-Organizer Stance and create space for Collaborator, buffer 'You' statements with 'I' statements to take responsiblity for your subjective perception of the situation.

For a Collaborator-Visionary Stance show acknowledgement of what they are saying through verbal and nonverbal means.

Invite a Driver-Collaborator Stance with No-Oriented Questions, questions that invite a response from the body.

To close off the conversation with an Organizer-Collaborator Stance, summarize the conversation in structured form while reflecting their emotional reality. If that reality is distorted, do [Two Sides](../two-sides/) and [Three Centers](../three-centers/) first. Approach this from a [Martial Attitude](../martial-attitude) and ask What and How questions in an curious and empathetic [Tone](../tone/) to find and address contraditions, stuck points, and the underlying root of that distorted worldview.
