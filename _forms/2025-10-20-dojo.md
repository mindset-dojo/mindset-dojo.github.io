---

## Intention

A Dojo is a [Circle](../circle/) of learning that embodies Fearless Leadership through practicing MetaShift Method on a [Mat](../mat/). The [Zensei](../zensei/), [Zenpai](../zenpai/), and [Zohai](../zohai/) model and guide and follow as it makes sense for their level of learning and responsibility.

## Experience

You will experience a playfully serious resonance that will invite you to relax completely. Entering the Dojo, you center with intention to meeting fear with presence, bringing good energy as you train with others.

## Implementation

One engages the [Mat](../mat/) within the [Circle](../circle/), thus making a Dojo. To be more precise, one infuses and leads a [Circle](../circle/) with a playfully serious resonance and centers with intention to meet fear with presence inviting [Circle](../circle/) members to relax completely and deepen the training.
