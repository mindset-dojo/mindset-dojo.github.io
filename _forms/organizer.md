## Intention

Part of the [Four Patterns](../four-patterns/) from Institute for Zen Leadership, Organizer (In Elemental [FEBI®](https://zenleader.global/resources/febi-assessment), it is also known as Earth) energy makes complexity legible through distillment, building the foundation for life to emerge and grow.

## Experience

### External  

Through care and diligence, you move and get rid of things as it makes sense. The process of distillment allows for you to move forward confidently to fulfill your responsiblities and dreams.

### Internal  

Organizer is your center. When above the line, it feels like alignment with your true Self, when below the line, one is fighting with and judging the world.

### Collective  

Organizer is the precondition to trust, allowing relaxation. However, when below the line, presence fades into process, and apathy reigns.

---

### Meta Compass Directions

- **Flowing + Above the Line:** Brings calm structure that supports growth, alignment, and shared stability.
- **Flowing + Below the Line:** Channels structure into control, policing details to manage fear or insecurity.
- **Stagnant + Above the Line:** Aims to support clarity but gets stuck overthinking, planning, or tightening.
- **Stagnant + Below the Line:** Collapses into rigid avoidance, clinging to rules or retreating from uncertainty.

Remember, everything you build is a debt. Thus build minimally and build fluidly. Maintain energy flow.

## Implementation

Using Organizer properly is about building emergent context-aware order. The things you build are your own reflection staring at you in the mirror.

### Implementing Our Principles

Release tension by taking [One Breath](../one-breath), and allow the [Visionary](../visionary/) and [Collaborator](../collaborator/) energy to blend in. Use [Two Sides](../two-sides/) to perceive things as they are, not as you want them to be, and feel where they want to go. Then align your [Three Centers](../three-centers/) and act. Don't be afraid to fail, since the road to success is paved with countless failures. Take failure as a learning opportunity instead of a indictment of your character. Order emerges from chaos through playfulness, inviting [Collaborator](../collaborator/).

### In Conversation

In conversation, Organizer invites alignment:

- Paraphrase what your conversational partner said to you to act as a mirror, showing engagment and understanding
- Buffer You statements with I statements to ensure personal distance through accountability, preventing unneeded discord
- Summarize the conversation ensures alignment to allow for closure
- A reasonable [Tone](../tone/) allows for optimum performance through psychological safety

When mature, Organizer simply reveals what is already there and invites others to join in.
