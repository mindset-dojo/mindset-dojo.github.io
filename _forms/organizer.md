## Intention

Part of the [Four Patterns](../four-patterns/) from Institute for Zen Leadership, Organizer (In Elemental [FEBI®](https://zenleader.global/resources/febi-assessment), it is also known as Earth) energy makes complexity legible through distillment, building the foundation for life to emerge and grow.

## Experience

### External  

Through care and diligence, you move and get rid of things as it makes sense. The process of distillment allows for you to move forward confidently to fulfill your responsiblities and dreams.

### Internal  

Organizer is your center. When above the line, it feels like alignment with your true Self, when below the line, one is fighting with and judging the world.

### Collective  

Organizer is the precondition to trust, allowing relaxation. However, when below the line, presence fades into process, and apathy reigns.

---

### Shadow & Variations  

Shadow – Controlling instead of connecting with chaos, pursuing a false sense of safety through artificial structure.

Overactive – Controlling every little thing, allowing nothing to grow or breathe.

Imploding – Coping, things pile up until everything breaks under it's own weight.

Disassociated – Tyranny of Structurelessness. Movement without clarity of purpose.

Remember, everything you build is a debt. Thus build minimally and build fluidly. Maintain energy flow.

## Implementation

Using Organizer properly is about building emergent context-aware order. The things you build are your own reflection staring at you in the mirror.

### Implementing Our Principles

Release tension by taking [One Breath](../one-breath), and allow the [Visionary](../visionary/) and [Collaborator](../collaborator/) energy to blend in. Use [Two Sides](../two-sides/) to perceive things as they are, not as you want them to be, and feel where they want to go. Then align your [Three Centers](../three-centers/) and act. Don't be afraid to fail, since the road to success is paved with countless failures. Take failure as a learning opportunity instead of a indictment of your character. Order emerges from chaos through playfulness, inviting [Collaborator](../collaborator/).

### In Conversation

In conversation, Organizer invites alignment:

- Paraphrasing acts as a mirror, showing engagment and understanding
- "I" Messages ensure personal distance through accountability, preventing unneeded discord
- Summary ensures alignment to allow for closure
- A reasonable [Tone](../tone/) allows for optimum performance through psychological safety

When mature, Organizer simply reveals what is already there and invites others to join in.
