## Intention

Part of the [4 Patterns](../four-patterns/) from Institute for Zen Leadership, Organizer energy sorts the complexity of the world so that it is legible.

## Experience

You are cleaning a messy room, figuring out what to keep and what to get rid of. Then you organize what you keep into various sections and boxes in the room.

## Implementation

You use Paraphrasing™ to show that you are listening, Summary™ to gauge alignment of ideals/course of action, and “I” Messages™ to take responsibility for what you are saying.
