## Intention

Stillness Contemplation is a beginner's meditation to sit (or lie) simply in silence. You can focus on one or more thoughts, but contemplate on them quietly to discern a deeper meaning.

## Experience

Your thoughts may come and go. If there is a thought or passage you want to especially focus on, you can go over it before starting Stillness Contemplation.

## Implementation

Engage with meaningful topics and consider thoughts and ideas that may (or may not) be brought into a [Circle](../circle/). Also consider ideas you want to meditate on for individual growth or insight.
