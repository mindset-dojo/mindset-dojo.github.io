## Intention

One Breath is from Zen Toolkit from Institute of Zen Leadership and is when one takes 3-5 Hara breaths (Belly Breathing) to center one's self. It can be used before, after, and during the conversations that matter, for one's breath is taken with you everywhere you go.

## Experience

As you breathe through the Hara, you achieve a sense of relaxed awareness, allowing one to act effortlessly.

## Implementation

One deeply breaths through their belly as slowly as possible. Repeat this breath 3-5 times. Make sure your exhale is longer than your inhale. Also, make sure your big toes touch something when you exhale.
