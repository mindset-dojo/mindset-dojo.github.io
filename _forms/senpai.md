excerpt: "A Senpai fearlessly learns MetaShift Method from the model and guidance of the Sensei, and acts as a guide and model for the Kohai."
---

## Intention

A Senpai fearlessly learns MetaShift Method from the model and guidance of the [Sensei](../sensei/), and acts as a guide and model for the [Kohai](../kohai/). They occasionally lead [Mat](../mat/) sessions and author Insights.

## Experience

You will experience a playfully serious resonance that will invite you to relax completely. You center yourself and your fellow peers with intention to meet fear with presence so that you expand as a Self-Author and Senpai.

## Implementation

To be a Senpai, one must have passed through the Blue Level Threshold. Teach [Kohai](../kohai/) and other Senpai what you know about Fearless Leadership and MetaShift Method in [Mat](../mat/) sessions.
