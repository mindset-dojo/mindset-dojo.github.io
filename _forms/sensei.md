## Intention

A Sensei fearlessly leads through modeling, guidance, and support through MetaShift Method. They lead [Mat](../mat/) sessions and author Insights regularly.

## Experience

You will experience a playfully serious resonance that will cause you to relax completely. You center yourself and your fellow peers with intention to meet fear with presence so that you expand as a Self-Author and Sensei.

## Implementation

To be a Sensei, one must have passed the Black Level Threshold and be vouched for by existing Sensei (relational trust [Threshold](../threshold)). Teach [Senpai](../senpai/) and [Kohai](../kohai/) what you know about Fearless Leadership and MetaShift Method in [Mat](../mat/) sessions.
