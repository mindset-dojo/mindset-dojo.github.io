excerpt: "Tone is not merely one's tone of voice, but rather the subliminal expression of the level of consciousness of a conversation — it quietly decides whether others open up, lash out, or shut down."

## Intention

Tone is not merely one's tone of voice, but rather the subliminal expression of the level of consciousness of a conversation — it quietly decides whether others open up, lash out, or shut down. [Breath](../one-breath/), body language, and voice all combine into Tone. It colors the individual's expression of the [Four Patterns](../four-patterns/), emerging into [Stances](../stance/). It is the lever of the Meta Compass, exposing and affecting what is being repressed or beneath the surface of the individuals themselves and the collective relational field. Through mastery of Tone, resonance is formed through energy flow and integration of what one is repressing.

## Experience

You feel the undercurrent of the conversation in your gut and are invited to resonate with it. However, the same is true for your counterpart. Through the [Martial Attitude](../martial-attitude/), applied through shifting [Stances](../stance/) to invite for a specific [Energy Pattern](../four-patterns/), you guide the conversation to mutually beneficial [Thresholds](../threshold/). The more experienced you are using Meta Compass, the more you feel a sense of calm awareness, balance - manuvering between the paradox (like breath itself) of emotional hyperactivity and inactivity, and can achieve effortless action.

## Implementation

### Preparation

First, you use [One Breath](../one-breath/) and then [Three Centers](../three-centers/) to align your Self.

### Introduction of Meta Compass

Using a [Three Question Reflection](../three-question-reflection/) and powered by [Meta Energy](../meta/), Meta Compass is a powerful and simple way to read the tone of a conversation. It measures the [Four Energy Patterns](../four-patterns/) that manifest in the conversation, then checks one's Ki orientation (if the energy is flowing) and one's position on the Map of Consciousness (above or below the line). With that knowledge, one can move the conversation in a mutually beneficial direction through well-timed [Stance](../stance/) transitions and invitations.

### How to use Meta Compass

First ask yourself:

> "What combination of the [4 Energy Patterns](../four-patterns/) is powering this conversation right now?"

This allows you to determine which [Stance](../stance/) you and your conversational partner are in, thus giving you the opportunity to change it if necessary.

You then ask another question:

> "Is the energy flowing, or is it stagnating or stuck? Am I going somewhere, or are we circling around the same point(s)?"

- **Flowing energy:** One is extending and connecting.
- **Stagnant energy:** One is contracting and disconnecting.  

If the energy is flowing, great! You can move on to the next gut check. If not, refer to the Stance Transitions section in [Stances](../stance/) for ways to get the conversation moving again.

Then check your own, and then your conversational partner(s) positions on the Map of Consciousness to figure out **where** the energy is flowing. When using the Map of Consciousness, ask yourself this:

> "Is the conversation and/or the individuals in the conversation trending above or below the line?"

What we mean by that is simple:

- **Below the line** (pride, fear, anger, shame): we are moving *away* from coherance.
- **Above the line** (love, reason, peace, enlightenment): we are moving *towards* coherance.

Blend with and invite further up if above the line. If the energy wave is below the line, don't fight fire with fire. Blend into and connect with the energy without being consumed by it and hold the lifeline downwards for your partner or yourself to move above the line.

### Conclusion

Through regular practice, using Meta Compass becomes instinctual, felt instead of thought. Once that happens, the correct course of action will come naturally.

Thus:

> Tone does not end in mastery, but infinitely begins with resonance.
