excerpt: "Tone is not merely one's tone of voice, but rather the subliminal expression of the level of consciousness of a conversation — it quietly decides whether others open up, lash out, or shut down."

## Intention

Tone is not merely one's tone of voice, but rather the subliminal expression of the level of consciousness of a conversation — it quietly decides whether others open up, lash out, or shut down. [Breath](../one-breath/), body language, and voice all combine into Tone. It colors the individual's expression of the [Four Patterns](../four-patterns/), emerging into [Stances](../stance/). It is the lever of David Hawkins's Map of Consciousness, exposing and affecting the Jungian shadow (what is being repressed or beneath the surface) of the individuals themselves and the collective relational field. Through mastery of Tone, resonance is formed through a Plus Ki (energy flow instead of stagnation) orientation through integration of the shadow.

## Experience

You feel the undercurrent of the conversation in your gut and are invited to resonate with it. However, the same is true for your counterpart. Through the [Martial Attitude](../martial-attitude/), applied through shifting [Stances](../stance/) to invite for a specific [Pattern](../four-patterns/), you guide the conversation to mutually beneficial [Thresholds](../threshold/). The higher you are on the Map of Consciousness, the more you feel a sense of calm awareness, balance - manuvering between the paradox (like breath itself) of emotional hyperactivity and inactivity, and can achieve Wu-Wei (effortless action).

## Implementation

First, you use [One Breath](../one-breath/) and then [Three Centers](../three-centers/) to align your Self. 

You then do a simple gut check of the conversation and the [Four Energy Patterns](../four-patterns/) underlying it:

> "Is the energy flowing, or is it stagnating or stuck? Am I going somewhere, or are we circling around the same point(s)?"

If the energy is flowing, great! You can move on to the next gut check. If not, refer to the Stance Transition section in [Stances](../stance/) for ways to get the conversation moving again. 

Then check your own, and then your conversational partner(s) positions on the Map of Consciousness to figure out **where** the energy is flowing. When using the Map of Consciousness, ask yourself this:

> "Is the conversation and/or the individuals in the conversation trending above or below the line?"

What we mean by that is simple:

- **Below the line** (reds and greys): we shrink, resist, blame, or collapse. Energy stagnates.
- **Above the line** (greens and higher): we expand, open, and create. Energy flows.

Then identify the specific position of the displayed emotions on the Map of Consciousness if needed. Remember, we do not use the Map of Consciousness as a ladder to climb once, but rather as a compass to check in the storm to find our Way. Blend with and invite further up if above the line. If the energy wave is below the line, don't fight fire with fire. Blend into and connect with the energy without being consumed by it and hold the lifeline downwards for your partner or yourself to climb up the Map of Consciousness.

Thus:

> Tone does not end in mastery, but infinitely begins with resonance.
