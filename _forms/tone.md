## Intention

Tone is not merely one's tone of voice, but rather the subliminal expression of the level of consciousness of a conversation — it quietly decides whether others open up, lash out, or shut down. [Breath](../one-breath/), body language, and voice all combine into Tone. It colors the individual's expression of the [Four Energy Patterns](../four-patterns/), emerging into the hue of [Stances](../stance/). It is the primary conversational lever, exposing and affecting what is being repressed or beneath the surface of the individuals themselves and the collective relational field. Through mastery of Tone, resonance is formed through energy flow and integration of what one is repressing.

## Experience

You have emotional awareness of the flow of the conversation, and the parties involved, which allows you to influence the conversation to mutually beneficial [Thresholds](../threshold/).

## Implementation

### Preparation

First, relax completely with [One Breath](../one-breath/) to center yourself and [Two Sides](../two-sides/) if helpful.

### Introduction of Meta Compass

Using a [Three Question Reflection](../three-question-reflection/), Meta Compass is a powerful and simple way to read the tone of a conversation. It suggests the [Four Energy Patterns](../four-patterns/) that manifest in the conversation, then checks one's energy flow and emotional level of the conversation. With that knowledge, one can influence the conversation in a mutually beneficial direction through well-timed [Stance](../stance/) transitions and invitations.

### How to use Meta Compass

First ask yourself:

> "What combination of or individual [Four Energy Patterns](../four-patterns/) do I and my conversational partner have?"

This allows you to determine which [Stance](../stance/) you and your conversational partner are in, thus giving you the opportunity to change it if necessary.

You then ask another question:

> "Is the energy flowing, or is it stagnating or stuck?"

- **Flowing energy:** One is extending and connecting.
- **Stagnant energy:** One is contracting and disconnecting.  

If the energy is flowing, great! You can move on to the next gut check.

If not, dissolve the stuck points using the [Stance Tips](../stance/) as appropriate.

Then figure out **where** the energy is flowing. Ask yourself this:

> "Is the emotion in the conversation trending positively or negatively?"

What we mean by that is simple:

- **Negatively trending** (pride, fear, anger, shame, etc.): we are moving *away* from coherance.
- **Positively trending** (love, reason, peace, enlightenment, etc.): we are moving *towards* coherance.

Blend with and invite further up if postively trending to elevate the emotional state. If the energy wave is negatively trending, don't fight fire with fire. Blend into and connect with the energy without being consumed by it and hold the lifeline downwards for your partner or yourself to move in a postive direction.

### Conclusion

Through regular practice, using Meta Compass becomes instinctual, felt instead of thought. Once that happens, the correct course of action will come naturally.

Thus:

> Tone does not end in mastery, but infinitely begins with resonance.
