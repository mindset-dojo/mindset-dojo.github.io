excerpt: "A reflection form for working with compression — meeting lower-consciousness forces without collapsing or bypassing. Integration through practice, not martyrdom."

## Intention

Maintain a high level of consciousness and connection under social pressure from surrounding lower level [FEBI®](https://zenleader.global/resources/febi-assessment) energies.

## Experience

You are feeling the pressure from the stagnant, negatively trending energies around you. They pressure you to give in and mirror their [Stance](../stance/), while you struggle to metabolize them and invite flowing, positively trending energies.

## Implementation

When challenged, train through looking at your internal mirror while maintaining outward presence. Do [One Breath](../one-breath/) and [Three Centers](../three-centers/) if helpful. Enter a flowing, postively trending Visionary-Organizer (with [Driver](../driver/) and [Collaborator](../collaborator/) support) [Stance](../stance/). Listen to [Meta energy](../meta/) and use the Meta Compass in [Tone](../tone/) to determine what your next [Stance](../stance/) should be. Then **act** from your Gut.
