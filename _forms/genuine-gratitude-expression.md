excerpt: "A form for recognizing genuine contributions of attention and energy — honoring mutual investment, resonance, and presence within and beyond the dojo."
---

## Intention

When people go above and beyond what they are required to do in terms of care or presence, acknowledge that. Gratitude is critical to sustaining healthy relationships, so make that a regular practice.

## Experience

You acknowledge the investment of finite energy and are genuinely grateful for the value you recieved from that investment, whether that was showing care, contribution, presence, or constructive challenging. You tailor that acknowledgement through showing it through [Tone](../tone/) and matching their [Stance](../stance/) to achieve resonance.

## Implementation

You start with a flowing, above the line Collaborator-Visionary (with just a touch of Organizer to support) [Stance](../stance/). Use Meta Compass in [Tone](../tone/) to make sure you are in the correct [Stance](../stance/) and have the correct [Tone](../tone/) before demonstrating this Form. Executing this Form incorrectly or without genuine gratitude can lead to significant backlash and resentment. 

Beyond the Form, make sure you are authentically aligned with Head, Heart, and Hara before communicating. [One Breath](../one-breath/), [Two Sides](../two-sides/) and [Three Centers](../three-centers/) can be helpful in preparation.

The key to successfully executing the Form is to tailor the expression of the Form to match the norms of the recipiant, the relationship, and the cultural context. Remember both Platnum and Golden Rules when expressing gratitude.
