excerpt: "A form for recognizing genuine contributions of attention and energy — honoring mutual investment, resonance, and presence within and beyond the dojo."

## Intention

When people go above and beyond what they are required to do in terms of care or presence, acknowledge that. Gratitude is critical to sustaining healthy relationships, so make that a regular practice.

## Experience

You acknowledge the investment of finite energy and are genuinely grateful for the value you recieved from that investment, whether that was showing care, contribution, presence, or constructive challenging. You tailor that acknowledgement through showing it through [Tone](../tone/) and matching their [Stance](../stance/) to achieve resonance.

## Implementation

As practitioners progress through the program, **Genuine Gratitude Expression** becomes a deeper study in relational awareness. When one feels ready to engage this practice intentionally, it is encouraged to learn from the model and to enter into conversation with [Senpai](../senpai/) and [Sensei](../sensei/) to explore how gratitude can be most skillfully and authentically expressed. Through dialogue, the practitioner learns to attune to timing, tone, and context, understanding that gratitude is not simply stated but embodied.
