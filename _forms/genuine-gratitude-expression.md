excerpt: "A form for recognizing genuine contributions of attention and energy — honoring mutual investment, resonance, and presence within and beyond the dojo."

## Intention

When people go above and beyond what they are required to do in terms of care or presence, acknowledge that. Gratitude is critical to sustaining healthy relationships, so make that a regular practice.

## Experience

In a dojo, every session begins and ends with a bow — a simple, shared gesture that acknowledges the mat, the teacher, and those we train with.  
**Genuine Gratitude Expression** extends that same embodied awareness beyond the [Mat](../mat/). It is the *bow of attention* — an energetic recognition of those who have shared presence, offered challenge, or contributed care.  

Following a shared practice, collaboration, or demonstration, the practitioner takes time to sense where attention and energy have truly been exchanged. This reflection includes noticing who has shown care, contribution, or courageous presence — and recognizing that every such act represents a redirection of finite human energy. The practitioner considers what this effort may have required from the other person or community, what intention was behind it, and what value it has added to the shared field.  

The expression of gratitude may take the form of words, gestures, or quiet acknowledgment, but what matters most is attunement — seeing and appreciating the other in a way that resonates with how they receive respect. Through this practice, gratitude becomes less about courtesy and more about coherence — the movement that keeps relational Ki flowing.

## Implementation

As practitioners progress through the program, **Genuine Gratitude Expression** becomes a deeper study in relational awareness. When one feels ready to engage this practice intentionally, it is encouraged to learn from the model and to enter into conversation with [Senpai](../senpai/) and [Sensei](../sensei/) to explore how gratitude can be most skillfully and authentically expressed. Through dialogue, the practitioner learns to attune to timing, tone, and context, understanding that gratitude is not simply stated but embodied.
