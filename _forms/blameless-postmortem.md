## Intention

Blameless Postmortem is [Three Question Reflection](../three-question-reflection/) done after a major incident or conflict within a [Circle](../circle/), where the blame is not put on the people, but the process that allowed that failure to occur.

## Experience

You will feel safe to share your insights while communicating with people and be able to get to the root of the problem through having conversations that matter, then change the pattern into a better one, restoring trust. You will learn greatly from this experience and integrate your learning through writing.

## Implementation

You assume [Martial Attitude](../martial-attitude) as a [Stance](../stance) and use Meta Compass in [Tone](../tone/) to invite a postively trending energy flowing Visionary-Collaborator [Stance](../stance/) to work together to determine the process that failed. Once that is found, invite a shift to a postively trending energy flowing Driver-Collaborator [Stance](../stance/) to change the failing process into a better one. Then while the incident or conflict is still fresh, write an Insight Article (in fable/anonymized format if need be) about it, create a Form to formalize the better pattern, and demonstrate both the failure, and the fix (Form pattern) on a live testing system with the same or similar settings to the original.
