## Intention

The love child of Elemental [FEBI®](https://zenleader.global/resources/febi-assessment), [Four Patterns](../four-patterns/), and Simon Says. Meant to integrate both left and right brain mode thinking into the body's nervous system. This allows one to embody energy agility through practicing the Four Patterns through motion.

## Experience

You center with intention to have playful resonance. You will relax completely as you will learn your energy edges and limits. Following this exercise is a good time to practice [Three Question Reflection](../three-question-reflection/).

## Implementation

### Steps

1. **Orient (2–3 min)**  
  Center the Circle and name the chosen set of patterns (Elemental or FEBI). Clarify the intention: playful embodiment and energy agility.

1. **Pattern Preview (2–3 min)**  
  The Sensei demonstrates brief movements for each pattern so everyone has a felt reference.

1. **Sensei Rotation (8–12 min)**  
  The starting [Sensei](../sensei/) leads a short movement sequence in one pattern, then calls the next Sensei *and* names the pattern they must lead. Each person becomes Sensei twice. Movements stay simple, clear, and embodied.

1. **Group Flow (3–5 min)**  
  The Circle moves together while leadership shifts fluidly—anyone may change the pattern, and everyone adapts immediately.

1. **Close (2–3 min)**  
  Return to stillness, acknowledge the [Circle](../circle/), and optionally capture a quick practice insight.
