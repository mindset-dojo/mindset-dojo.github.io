## Intention

The Kohai–Senpai Relationship is a traditional Japanese dynamic of mutual respect and learning.  
It describes how people relate based on relative experience, not formal rank.

A **Kohai** is someone newer to the path.  
A **Senpai** is someone with more experience who offers guidance, steadiness, and example.

These roles are contextual and fluid.  
In one moment you may be Senpai; in another, Kohai.  
No one “earns” these titles—they express the natural flow of learning between people.

## Experience

This relationship creates a warm, grounded atmosphere where learning happens through presence and example, not authority.

As Kohai, you practice:

- Observing closely  
- Asking honest questions  
- Receiving guidance with openness  
- Showing respect through effort  

As Senpai, you practice:

- Modeling steadiness and humility  
- Offering guidance without superiority  
- Supporting others with care and clarity  
- Staying connected to the openness of a beginner  

Both sides cultivate a playfully serious spirit—meeting each moment with curiosity and sincerity.

## Implementation

### Kohai Responsibilities

Kohai bring:

- Willingness to learn  
- Respect for the process and their Senpai  
- Appreciation, effort, and follow-through  

Kohai are not subordinate; they are supported learners.

### Senpai Responsibilities

Senpai bring:

- Example-setting through action  
- Gentle guidance and encouragement  
- A steady presence that others can rely on  

Senpai are not in charge; they are experienced peers who walk ahead and look back to help others follow.

### Fluid and Contextual Roles

Kohai and Senpai are not titles you carry—they arise from:

- Who has more experience in a given moment  
- Who is modeling something for whom  
- Who is learning something new  

The relationship forms a circle of mutual uplift, not a hierarchy.
