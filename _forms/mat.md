excerpt: "A Mat is a martial attitude one brings with them to do mutual (Jungian) shadow integration through embodied practice."
---

## Intention

A Mat is a martial attitude one brings with them to do mutual (Jungian) shadow integration through embodied practice. That attitude is a playful one that meets fear with presence. It is the Yang to the [Circle's](../circle/) Yin.

## Experience

You will center with intention to meet fear with presence. Meeting fear with presence will allow you to relax completely and engage the deep training with eventually playful but definately serious energy.

## Implementation

One can train on a Mat by themselves or collectively in a [Circle](../circle/). Both types of training require calibrated questions to find stuck points, dynamic silence to invite the other to answer honestly, and paraphrasing what they said to ensure mutual understanding. Again, Webs of Trust are Ki to doing this training safely.
