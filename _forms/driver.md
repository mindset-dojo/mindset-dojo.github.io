## Intention

Part of the [4 Patterns](../four-patterns/) from Institute for Zen Leadership, Driver energy concentrates your focus and moves you forward.

## Experience

You are in the strike zone, all attention focused on the ball heading towards you. You take your shot and hit the ball, causing it to fly outward into the stadium for a home run.

## Implementation

You use Calibrated Questions™ to explore and drive the conversation forward, “I” Messages™ to take responsibility for what you are saying and soften the blow, and Summary™ to tie off the conversation.
