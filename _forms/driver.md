## Intention

Part of the [Four Patterns](../four-patterns/) from Institute for Zen Leadership, Driver (In Elemental [FEBI®](https://zenleader.global/resources/febi-assessment), it is also known as Fire) energy is like a laser. It causes you to focus on moving foward, step by step.

## Experience

### External

You are in a flow state, following the impulse to do something whereever that came from to it's end state. As you get closer to the destination, so does the momentum carrying you there.

### Internal  

When postively trending, effortless action emerges from one's being with a sense of calm alertness, feeling like a part of the universe. When negatively trending, one's awareness shrinks down to a point, driven by fear and frustration to fight time itself.

### Collective  

Driver is the start of resonance, taking that first step on the journey. It sets the beat of the drum that everyone else follows. With postively trending [Collaborator](../collaborator/), it unites people around a point of focus into a movement. With negatively trending [Collaborator](../collaborator/), it leaves behind or runs people over.

### Meta Compass Directions

- **Flowing + Postively Trending:** Moves decisively with relaxed confidence, turning clarity into constructive action.
- **Flowing + Negatively Trending:** Becomes forceful and aggressive, pushing forward with ego-driven urgency.
- **Stagnant + Postively Trending:** Wants to act constructively but freezes, second-guesses, or hesitates under tension.
- **Stagnant + Negatively Trending:** Shuts down into frustration or withdrawal when action feels futile or dangerous.

Feel into the existing Driver energy waves that are there, and blend with them to influence them.

## Implementation

Driver comes from the momentum born of habit, not forced out when you need it.

### Implementing Our Principles

Release tension by taking [One Breath](../one-breath), and allow the [Visionary](../visionary/) and [Collaborator](../collaborator/) energy to blend in. You are at your most powerful when relaxed, paradoxically, since you are working with instead of against the flow. Feel into the collective field to attract the future that wants to happen and find what resonates with you, then at the moment of maximum connection between you and your context, **move**. Remember, fear often signals opportunity for growth, and playfulness keeps you in the Game.

### In Conversation  

When communicating, Driver probes into and resolves conversations.

**Tips:**

- Use What and How questions to move the conversation forward through invitation, not force.  
- Take responsibility for what you are saying by buffering You statements with I statements.
- Summarize the conversation to ensure alignment so the conversation can conclude cleanly.
- A confident, firm [Tone](../tone/) invites action and trust.  

When mature, Driver allows you to move forward towards your ideals while maintaining connection with everything else.
