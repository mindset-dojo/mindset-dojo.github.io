## Intention

A Zohai follows the [Zensei'](../zensei/) and [Zenpai'](../zenpai/) fearless leadership, and applies MetaShift Method to the best of their ability. They author Insights to cross each Level's threshold and to internalize their learning.

## Experience

You will experience a playfully serious resonance that will invite you to relax completely. You join the [Mat](../mat/) with intention to meet fear with presence.

## Implementation

To be a Zohai, one must have been invited to the [Mat](../mat/) and crossed the White Level threshold. Learn about and embody Fearless Leadership and MetaShift Method through training.
