## Intention

The love child of Elemental FEBI™, Four Patterns, and Simon Says. Meant to integrate both left and right brain mode thinking into the body's nervous system. This allows one to embody energy agility through practicing the Four Patterns through motion.

## Experience

You center with intention to have playful resonance. You will relax completely as you will learn your energy edges and limits. Following this exercise is a good time to practice [Three Question Reflection](../three-question-reflection/).

## Implementation

Find a [Circle](../circle/), engage the [Mat](../mat/), and begin the game. The [Zensei](../zensei/) picks either the Elemental (Fire, Water, Earth, Air) or FEBI™ (Driver, Collaborator, Organizer, Visionary) version of the 4 Patterns. The rest of the [Circle](../circle/) in the [Mat](../mat/) session follows the lead of the [Zensei](../zensei/) and imitates them. The [Zensei](../zensei/) then names another member of the [Circle](../circle/), the [Zensei](../zensei/), while naming the Pattern they want the group to imitiate. This cycle repeats until everyone in the [Circle](../circle/) has been [Zensei](../zensei/) twice.
