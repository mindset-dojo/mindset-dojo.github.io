## Intention

When you notice another person is indecisive/lacks [Driver](../driver/), you can create a [Threshold](../threshold/) for them to go through to get that [Driver](../driver/) energy flowing. That forces a decision from the body, not just the mind going along with an interesting idea.

## Experience

### Before

Before the Driver Cut, you feel very wishy-washy and uncommitted, just here to have fun.

### During

During the Driver Cut, you feel a sense of pressure as another holds you accountable. This can lead to resentment if the technique is done improperly.

### After

After the Driver Cut, you either feel a sense of purpose and alignment if you accept it, or a sense of freedom and loss if you don't.

## Implementation

First, use Meta Compass in [Tone](../tone/) to figure out your own and your partner's energies. Driver Cuts require multiple things: 1. That the other party is invested in the relationship, 2. That the other party has significant Driver potential not being utilized, 3. That the [Threshold](../threshold/) is drawn cleanly and clearly. If all of the following are true, and they are stuck in [Visionary](../visionary/) energy, then the Driver Cut is useful. If not, try something else that is suited for them.

You then draw a [Threshold](../threshold/) for the other party so that it is clear that they have to focus and commit. You want to coax out a No from them, a No that agrees with you through reverse psychology. For example, "Is this a bad time to have our discussion?" That honest No is more meaningful than a counterfeit Yes, because not only did they had to put thought into it, they had to work against the body's instinct to say Yes (false [Collaborator](../collaborator/)), leading to greater committment.

If they cross the [Threshold](../threshold/), great! If not, they crossed a [Threshold](../threshold/) of their own, and further energy exchange with them will likely be useless at this point in time.
