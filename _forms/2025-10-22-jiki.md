excerpt: "The Jiki takes responsibility for the space — directing rhythm, posture, and presence so the field can settle into coherence."

## Intention

To hold and lead the meditation field with clarity, firmness, and care.  
The Jiki is responsible for the space itself — the rhythm, posture, and collective attention that allow practice to deepen as field.

## Experience

As Jiki, you are both participant and conductor.  
You sit in the same silence as others, but your awareness extends to the whole room — physical and virtual.  
You are responsible for the collective form: posture, stillness, alignment, and sound.  
When coherence drifts — someone shifts, slouches, forgets mute, or the camera frame is off — you give clear, direct instruction to restore the field.  
Sometimes that guidance is gentle; sometimes it’s sharp. Both arise from care for the practice and respect for those training within it.

## Implementation

To serve as Jiki, one undertakes training tangential but complementary to the Mindset Dojo program — through [Chosei Zen](https://www.choseizen.org/) or a related lineage of embodied Zen practice.  
For proper introductions and guidance on integrating this role with Mindset Dojo’s training progression, work with [Zensei'](../zensei/), who can offer appropriate introductions, formal pointers and generally help you orient to leading zazen sessions within the program.
