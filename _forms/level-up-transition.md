## Intention

A level-up transition is not a reward or a promotion. It is a shift in awareness. A moment when you realize that your practice has begun to change you — and that a new phase of training is opening.

This form supports that shift. It slows the moment down so you can recognize what is moving, what is deepening, and what is ready to be crossed. It invites you to connect with peers, [Senpai](../senpai/), and [Sensei](../sensei/), because progress in a [dojo](../dojo/) is never a solitary act.

A level-up transition is a chance to sense where you are, where you’ve been, and where you are now being invited.

## Experience

Transitions often feel subtle at first — a new steadiness, a softening of old reactivity, or a quiet sense that you’re beginning to lead without forcing it.

Form based practice may seem repetitive at times, but repetition brings shape. It reveals patterns that carried you through the previous phase, and it shows where gaps and edges still remain — in presence, in coherence, or in embodiment.

A transition becomes visible when you notice yourself moving differently: how you listen, how you speak, how you recover, how you sense the field. These are the markers of the shift.

## Implementation

Connect with others in this phase — not as a requirement, but as a practice.

- Reach out to peers and reflect together on how each of you has changed.  
- Engage a [Senpai](../senpai/) and or [Sensei](../sensei/) for a conversation to sense what is emerging in you.  
- Notice where leadership begins to arise naturally — not assigned, not claimed, simply present.  
- Bring awareness to the [Thresholds](../threshold/) you have crossed in this level: what you carried in, what transformed, and what remains unresolved.  
- Sense into the gaps and edges you are aware of now that you couldn’t see before.

### Reflective Harvest

As part of leveling up, you will create a short insight article capturing this transition.  In your written insight, reflect on:

- Your experience crossing this [Threshold](../threshold/)  
- What shifted in your practice, presence, or patterns  
- What you learned from [Circle](../circle/), [Mat](../mat) and other form-based training  
- What was distilled from the previous phase  
- What gaps and edges remain and how you intend to relate to them  
- What becomes possible for you — and for those you train with — as you move into the next level

This reflective harvest completes the Level Up Transition and becomes part of the living [dojo](../dojo/).
