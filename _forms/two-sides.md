## Intention

Two Sides is part of the Zen Toolkit from Institute of Zen Leadership and is where you evaluate both sides of an argument/narrative to see what is valid and what concerns exist.

## Experience

You see through the Other's eyes as well as your own, allowing you to truly connect with them and collapse the false seperation.

## Implementation

First, review the [Zen Toolkit - Two Sides Instructional Video](https://vimeo.com/944663134/d4f1c4f333).

Take notes as necessary, then practice the exercise for yourself.

After that, see how it is expressed in Mindset Dojo training:

Draw a quadrant on a piece of paper. At the same time, get a straight object like your belt or a yardstick and place it on the floor. One side is your Self, the other side is the Other. Upper Quadrant is Virtues, Bottom Quadrant is Concerns. While filling out the paper Quadrants, move accordingly on the floor. When finished, evaluate the Quadrant to see commonalities and differences.
