## Intention

Revealed Preference Reflection is a combination of [Stillness Contemplation](../stillness-contemplation) and [Integration Under Fire](../integration-under-fire), analyzing one's desires through their actions continuously. Through crossing a [Threshold](../threshold) and sacrificing something, like time or energy, to do so one reveals their priorities.

## Experience

One sits with their own or another's actions until they make sense. Many negative emotions can come up while doing this, including sadness, betrayal, or fear. One confronts those feelings with presence.

## Implementation

You reflect upon your own or another's actions, and your shadow is revealed through the stuck points. This is Ki to understanding people's true priorities, especially in cases of manipulation or self-deception.
