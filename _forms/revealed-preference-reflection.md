## Intention

Revealed Preference Reflection is a combination of [Stillness Contemplation](../stillness-contemplation) and [Integration Under Fire](../integration-under-fire), analyzing one's desires through their actions continuously. Through crossing a [Threshold](../threshold) and sacrificing something, like time or energy, to do so one reveals their priorities.

## Experience

You sit with your own or another's actions until they make sense from your perspective. Many negative emotions can come up while doing this, including sadness, betrayal, or fear. One connects with those feelings through presence.

## Implementation

You reflect upon your own or another's actions, and your shadow (what you don't acknowledge about yourself) is revealed through the stuck points. This is critical to achieving a personal understanding of people's motivations, especially in cases of manipulation or self-deception.
