## Intention

Four Patterns is from Zen Toolkit from Institute of Zen Leadership and introduces the archtypical FEBI™ energies (Driver, Organizer, Collaborator, Visionary) into embodied practice through motion. Those energies represent common aspects of people's personalities. Through practice, one can tap into those parts of themselves at will.

## Experience

You will feel the FEBI™ energies course through you as you move in accordance with the corresponding Pattern. Some energies will likely be easier for you to tap into than others. Repeated practice will allow you to recognize these Patterns and energies in your daily life, and thus give you the opportunity to shift them.

## Implementation

1. Review [the video](https://vimeo.com/944675826/c57a7ce142).
2. See our interpretation below:

    **Driver (Fire)**

    When moving, **focus**, narrow your vision and move towards your goal with sharp movements. You can jab straight ahead of you, like emphasizing something in someone's face. You can turn your hands into perpendicular planes, and use the vertical plane to hit the horizontal plane. You can stomp hard with your feet. You can also make an hand-gun with both of your hands, folding your hands together and aligning your index fingers in a straight line, arms straight ahead while aiming, and fire.

    **Organizer (Earth)**

    When moving, get everything aligned and in order. Focus on your posture and order your movement. Align your hands into parallel planes, and make a box out of negative space in your mind using your motion. Tip your upper body side to side while leaving your lower body still, and feel the pivot point in the Solar Plexus. Take a step forward, back, left, or right with one foot, and then bring your other foot to align with the first foot.

    **Collaborator (Water)**

    When moving, go with the flow. Keep shaking your hands, feeling the vibration. Then make figure eights with your arms, feeling the wave-like movement.

    **Visionary (Air)**

    When moving, feel the possibilities. Move your arms and hands around you, never repeating the same motion, feeling the freedom you have. Allow your tension to fade away.
