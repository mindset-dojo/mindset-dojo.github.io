## Intention

Four Energy Reflection is the entry form for Mindset Dojo training — an inner dojo before the outer one. Through [FEBI®](https://zenleader.global/resources/febi-assessment) (Focus Energy Balance Indicator) assessment, guided review, and reflection, we map our energetic signatures and begin training awareness of how energy moves through us.  

This form introduces the Four Energy Patterns (FEBI - Driver, Organizer, Collaborator, Visionary) as living expressions of focus, structure, relationship, and possibility. By seeing and naming our patterns, we begin to train choice — moving from habit to authorship.

## Experience

Across this process you will:

- Complete the FEBI assessment to reveal your natural energy pattern distribution.  
- Review your personal report, recognizing how your energies express through work, communication, and presence.  
- Unpack in a [Sensei](../sensei/) guided session to explore how energy shapes focus, stress response, and relational stance.  
- Reflect and integrate through a short written or spoken insight, marking your first [Threshold](../threshold/) in the dojo.  
- Optionally continue practice through other form work or joining the Mindset Dojo program.

Each published reflection becomes part of the open-source living field of practice.

## Implementation

  Read your results; highlight patterns that feel familiar or surprising.  

1. **[Sensei](../sensei/) Guided Unpacking (30–45 min)**  
  Engage in dialogue to interpret your energy distribution in context.  

1. **Integration (30-60 min)**
