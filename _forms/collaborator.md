## Intention

Part of the [4 Patterns](../four-patterns/) from Institute for Zen Leadership, Collaborator energy creates resonance from relationship through alignment.

## Experience

### External  

Through presence, you connect with others in the conversation. Instead of a script to be read, a dance flows forth.

### Internal  

You are calmly aware, open to and flowing with the Other. Above the line, one blends with without dissolving. Below the line, one is absorbed by the Other.

### Collective  

Collaborator is the glue holding together social groups. Above the line, people trust and participate freely. Below the line is slavery and compliance.

---

### Shadow & Variations  

Shadow – Everything is performance, nothing is secure.  

Overactive – Groupthink personified, sacrificing one's individuality on the altar of normalcy.  

Imploding – Resentment born of giving without receiving gratitude.

Disassociated – No warmth, only performance and virtue-signaling.

Connect with others, without living through them.

## Implementation

Practice begins with body language and [Tone](../tone/).

### Implementing Our Principles

Release tension by taking [One Breath](../one-breath), and allow the [Visionary](../visionary/) and [Collaborator](../collaborator/) energy to blend in. Use [Two Sides](../two-sides/) to perceive things as they are, not as you want them to be, and feel where they want to go. Then align your [Three Centers](../three-centers/) and act. Confront vulnerability and be honest, since that invites authenticity and trust. Playful resonance forms from the ability to trust each other.

---

### In Conversation  

In conversation, Collaborator allows for a shared perception of reality:

- Labels surface underlying feelings, allowing them to be acknowledged  
- Encouragers show presence and mutual support.
- A caring, soft [Tone](../tone/) shows empathy through one's actions.

When mature, Collaborator creates harmony out of the emergent order.
