## Intention

Part of the [Four Patterns](../four-patterns/) from Institute for Zen Leadership, Collaborator (In Elemental [FEBI®](https://zenleader.global/resources/febi-assessment), it is also known as Water) energy creates resonance from relationship through alignment.

## Experience

### External  

Through presence, you connect with others in the conversation. Instead of a script to be read, a dance flows forth.

### Internal  

You are calmly aware, open to and flowing with the Other. Postively trending, one blends with without dissolving. Negatively trending, one is absorbed by the Other.

### Collective  

Collaborator is the glue holding together social groups. Postively trending, people trust and participate freely. Negatively trending is slavery and compliance.

---

### Meta Compass Directions

- **Flowing + Postively Trending:** Creates warm resonance that strengthens connection and mutual uplift.
- **Flowing + Negatively Trending:** Spreads emotional entanglement, overhelping or appeasing to avoid conflict.
- **Stagnant + Postively Trending:** Tries to connect but collapses into self-doubt, losing presence or voice.
- **Stagnant + Negatively Trending:** Implodes into submissiveness, people-pleasing, or emotional retreat.

Connect with others, without living through them.

## Implementation

Practice begins with body language and [Tone](../tone/).

### Implementing Our Principles

Release tension by taking [One Breath](../one-breath), and allow the [Driver](../driver/) and [Visionary](../visionary/) energy to blend in. Perceive things as they are, not as you want them to be, and feel where they want to go. Then **act**. Confront vulnerability and be honest, since that invites authenticity and trust. Playful resonance forms from the ability to trust each other.

### In Conversation  

In conversation, Collaborator allows for a shared perception of reality:

- Label underlying feelings in the conversation to surface them, allowing them to be acknowledged  
- Show that you are present verbally and nonverbally to show presence and mutual support.
- A caring, soft [Tone](../tone/) shows empathy through one's actions.

When mature, Collaborator creates harmony out of the emergent order.
