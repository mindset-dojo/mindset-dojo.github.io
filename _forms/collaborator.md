## Intention

Part of the [4 Patterns](../four-patterns/) from Institute for Zen Leadership, Collaborator energy is what makes one want to and be able to work with other people. It is critical to creating and maintaining resonance and thus wider impact.

## Experience

## Implementation

You use Labels™ to surface underlying emotions, Encouragers™ to show your engagement, and a playful, warm [Tone](../tone/) to show that you care.
