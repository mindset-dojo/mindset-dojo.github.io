excerpt: "A threshold is the line between thought and action, Visionary and Driver energy."
---

## Intention

A threshold is the line between thought and action, Visionary and Driver energy. It is when the body is invited to act and make a decision. As some martial arts masters say, "Mind moves Body"<sup>1</sup>. Thus the decision will be based on one's values, attitudes, and general conditioning.

## Experience

You may feel tension as you get close to the threshold. However, to refuse to cross a threshold one has offered for you, is to cross a threshold you set out for yourself. Thus, one can never truly refuse to cross a threshold, doing nothing is still a decision, thus one can only choose which thresholds to cross. We are always crossing thresholds in our life, whether we are aware of it or not.

## Implementation

When you offer a threshold, remember that you, too, are crossing it. You become part of the relationship that forms around that invitation. With that comes responsibility for the impact it may have. Offer as much context as you can, so that what you extend is not manipulation but genuine invitation.

If they cross through on their own, or you cross together, wonderful. If only one—or neither—steps through, stay with what arises. Reflect on the edges and gaps that surface in you when their decision unsettles you.

When encountering a threshold—whether it reveals itself naturally or is offered by another—begin with [Three Centers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuK3HOIfUiw): check your mind, emotions, and gut. If they are not aligned, inquire which center is out of sync and why.
When alignment emerges, act. Cross. Don’t let the opportunity dissolve into hesitation.
