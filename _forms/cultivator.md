## Intention

A Cultivator engages with [the Dojo](../dojo/) using their domain expertise to support going through a Program [Threshold](../threshold/) in a reasonable amount of time agreed upon with the [Sensei](../sensei/). Instead of contributing money, they contribute labor to ensure fair energy exchange when passing the [Threshold](../threshold/). They volunteer their experience in a mutually beneficial way during the agreed upon phase.

## Experience

You train and contribute to the Dojo while meeting with the Sensei as it makes sense about your contributions and progress towards the Program Level [Threshold](../threshold/).

As you work for the community, you'll begin noticing how clarity, alignment, and movement arise from shared action rather than debate, and how transparency lightens even complex efforts. Cultivation becomes a living expression of responsiveness.

## Implementation

To enter the Cultivator phase:

- Express your intent to contribute to the Project and Community with the [Sensei](../sensei/).
- Work with the [Sensei](../sensei/) to align the contribution phase with crossing a Level [Threshold](../threshold/) in a reasonable amount of time.

As you cultivate the Program and Community, let your work be guided the following principles:  

- **Nothing Hidden, Nothing Forced** — share what you see and intend so momentum can align without pressure.  
- **Alignment Comes From Action** — contribute early and lightly; each step reveals the domain’s true shape.  
- **Presence Over Process** — respond to what’s happening now rather than clinging to a plan.  
- **Movement Creates the Path** — keep the domain light and alive; let motion clarify what’s needed.

Held lightly, these principles help your efforts evolve naturally, without heaviness or friction.
