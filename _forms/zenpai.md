excerpt: "A Zenpai fearlessly learns MetaShift Method from the model and guidance of the Zensei, and acts as a guide and model for the Zohai."
---

## Intention

A Zenpai fearlessly learns MetaShift Method from the model and guidance of the [Zensei](../zensei/), and acts as a guide and model for the [Zohai](../zohai/). They occasionally lead [Mat](../mat/) sessions and author Insights.

## Experience

You will experience a playfully serious resonance that will invite you to relax completely. You center yourself and your fellow peers with intention to meet fear with presence so that you expand as a Self-Author and Zenpai.

## Implementation

To be a Zenpai, one must have passed through the Blue Level Threshold. Teach [Zohai](../zohai/) and other Zenpai what you know about Fearless Leadership and MetaShift Method in [Mat](../mat/) sessions.
