## Intention

An Arena is a scenario-based training ground where participants bring real situations and practice responding through the dojo form reflexes — a synthesis of embodied practices that integrate mind, body, and conversation. Training is centered on the FEBI™—the Four Energy Patterns (Driver, Organizer, Collaborator, Visionary)—and blends other Mindset Dojo forms to cultivate presence and agility under real conditions.

An Arena bridges conceptual learning and threshold practice — it is where insight meets contact.

## Experience

You bring a real-life scenario that matters — a moment of tension, misunderstanding, or opportunity. Through guided rounds of role-play and embodied reflection:  

- You witness your default response and its energetic signature.  
- You re-enter the same moment using a specific energy pattern as your stance.  
- You feel the difference in breath, tone, and relational impact.  
- You reflect and integrate, noticing how your nervous system learns to stay open under pressure.  

Each Arena is alive—co-created through the immediate energy of those present. 

## Implementation

1. Orient (10–20 min) — establish safety, set intentions, and revisit the FEBI model.  
2. Default Run (20–25 min) — enact your natural, habitual response.  
3. Pattern Run (35–45 min) — re-enter through one of the four energies:  
   - Driver: decisive, grounded, clear  
   - Organizer: structured, reliable, stabilizing  
   - Collaborator: open, connected, co-regulating  
   - Visionary: expansive, intuitive, adaptive  
4. Debrief (15–20 min) — collective mirroring and somatic observation.  
5. Integration (20–25 min) — personal reflection and insight capture.  
6. Close (5–10 min) — energetic reset and next-practice invitation.
