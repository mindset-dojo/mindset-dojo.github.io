## Intention

Through regular writing to integrate the results of practices like [Stillness Contemplation](../stillness-contemplation/) and [Three Question Reflection](../three-question-reflection/), Self-Authors gain the ability to rewrite their own narrative through adjusting their [Stance](../stance/). As the writer progresses through the program, they can earn and maintain an Self-Authorship leadership designation.

## Experience

You realize that you can change yourself, and take responsiblity for your own life trajectory. You regularly write and publish on the site both to integrate your own insights and to share them with others. Through supporting others, you yourself are supported.

## Implementation

As you progress through the program, you can earn and maintain a Self-Authorship leadership designation. The designations are:

- Contributing Author
- Trusted Author

Contributing Author is at least Yellow Level, and publishes regularly. They get to publish Insight articles without human review if they pass the automated quality gates.

Trusted Author is at least Red Level, and publishes regularly. They can override the automated quality gates for Insight articles, and self-publish. They also review Insights if necessary.

Write regularly, make sure to reflect upon and discuss your writings with others in an [Authorship Circle](../circle/), and your efforts will be recognized within the community.
