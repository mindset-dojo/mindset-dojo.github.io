excerpt: "Randori is a presence-training form where we practice staying centered and adaptive as energy moves—expressed through the Four Energy Patterns: Driver, Organizer, Collaborator, and Visionary."

## Intention

Randori (lit. "seizing chaos”) is a living expression of presence training. We meet unpredictable conditions—inner and interpersonal—and train to remain centered, connected, and responsive. All practice is pattern-aware: the Four Energy Patterns (Driver, Organizer, Collaborator, Visionary) provide the root lens and language for noticing, shifting, and integrating energy in real time.

Randori unifies Mindset Dojo forms into a single field of practice. It is where insight becomes contact, and contact becomes integration.

## Experience

Across formats—conversation drills, scenario play, quiet presence, or group flow—you will:

- Recognize your default stance and its energetic signature.  
- Shift intentionally among energies—cut (Driver), stabilize (Organizer), harmonize (Collaborator), expand (Visionary).  
- Transition fluidly as conditions change, maintaining breath, tone, and Ki extension.  
- Integrate by capturing a brief reflection for the Open Source Mindset Dojo book.

Each Randori adapts to the people present and the energy at hand.

## Implementation

1. Orient (10–15 min) — safety, intention, and a quick refresh of the Four Energy frame.  
2. Baseline Pass (15–25 min) — meet the moment “as you are” to reveal defaults.  
3. Pattern Practice (35–50 min) — targeted rounds exploring one or more energies.  
4. Free Randori (20–30 min) — spontaneous flow where energies shift dynamically.  
5. Debrief (15–20 min) — mirrors on breath, body, timing, and relational impact.  
6. Integration (10–20 min) — authored reflection or fable; next-practice commitment.  
7. Close (5–10 min) — reset the field; invite the next threshold.

Formats: solo, dyad, triad, group circle, or real-life; online or in-person.  
Roles: facilitator/senpai, participants.
