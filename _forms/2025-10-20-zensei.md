## Intention

A Zensei fearlessly leads through modeling, guidance, and support through MetaShift Method. They lead [Mat](../mat/) sessions and author Insights regularly.

## Experience

You will experience a playfully serious resonance that will cause you to relax completely. You center yourself and your fellow peers with intention to meet fear with presence so that you expand as a Self-Author and Zensei.

## Implementation

To be a Zensei, one must have passed the Black Level Threshold and have [Zen Leadership Instructor Designation](https://zenleader.global/programs/coachinstructor/zlinstructor). Teach [Zenpai](../zenpai/) and [Zohai](../zohai/) what you know about Fearless Leadership and MetaShift Method in [Mat](../mat/) sessions.
