## Intention

Circles are brave spaces for mutual exploration and reflection bound together by a web of trust and shared principles. They are the Yin to the [Mat's](../mat/) Yang.

## Experience

You will feel safe to share your insights while communicating with people and have deep sustained conversations that matter.

## Implementation

Start with a few people you trust, then invite friends they trust. Webs of trust form the foundation of psychological safety that Circles are built off of. When well formed, centering with intention and then meeting fear with presence is Ki. That sustains the relational energy field and creates the conditions for relaxing completely and having a playful community resonance.
