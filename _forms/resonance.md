## Intention

Resonance is the ripple effect of the Self obtaining coherency by integrating the [Four Patterns](../four-patterns/) into the collective field through Presence. Like a uncracked bell ringing clearly, as one becomes more coherent, the wider one's vibe or resonance rings.

## Experience

You are centered and present with others. That presence raises the level of consciousness of the room, coregulating the collective field. You are part of the flow, and stuff gets done like a waterfall rushing downwards.

## Implementation

You start by applying Meta Compass in [Tone](../tone/). Also consider doing [Two Sides](../two-sides/) and [Three Centers](../three-centers/) if helpful. That allows you to vibe check the room, and feel your way into an opportunity to direct the conversation through mutually beneficial [Thresholds](../threshold/). Remember, Resonance is based in [Collaborator](../collaborator/) not [Organizer](../organizer/) [FEBI®](https://zenleader.global/resources/febi-assessment) energies! You don't build a movement, the movement emerges like a wave of action originating from the movements of the first drop of water.
