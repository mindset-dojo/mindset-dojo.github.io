## Intention

Randori (lit. “seizing chaos”) invites us to meet unpredictable conditions—inner, interpersonal, and situational—while remaining centered, connected, and adaptive. With Mindset Dojo, randori is always pattern-aware: the Four Energy Patterns (Driver, Organizer, Collaborator, Visionary from FEBI™) provide the frame for noticing how energy moves, how we respond, and how we can shift with intention.

Four Energy Randori integrates the dojo’s practices into one living field. It is where insight becomes contact, and contact becomes integration.

## Experience

In Four Energy Randori, the “attack” is not a person—it is the moment. You engage changing conditions through conversation, timing, attention, conflict, collaboration, stillness, or relational pressure.

With guidance from [Sensei](../sensei/) and support from [Senpai](../senpai/), you’ll train through solo sensing, dyads, triads, and group flow:

- Notice your default stance and energetic signature.  
- Shift intentionally among the Four Energies:
  - **Driver** to cut through, act, or clarify.  
  - **Organizer** to stabilize, structure, or align.  
  - **Collaborator** to join, connect, or harmonize.  
  - **Visionary** to expand, reframe, or open space.  
- Recover center as conditions shift—breath, posture, voice, timing.  
- Integrate insights in a brief reflection for the Open Source Mindset Dojo book.

Each randori adapts to who is present and what the moment demands.

## Implementation

### Steps

1.  **Orient (10–15 min)**  
  Establish safety, intention, and review the Four Energy frame.

1.  **Baseline Pass (15–25 min)**  
  Engage the scenario or drill exactly as you are. This reveals default energy patterns.

1.  **Pattern Practice (35–50 min)**  
  Targeted rounds exploring one or more energies in contrast or combination.

1.  **Free Randori (20–30 min)**  
  Spontaneous flow where conditions shift and energies must adapt in real time.

1.  **Debrief (15–20 min)**  
  Reflect on breath, body, voice, timing, attention, and relational impact.

1.  **Integration (10–20 min)**  
  Capture a short written insight or fable; articulate a next-practice commitment.
  
1.  **Close (5–10 min)**  
  Reset the field and acknowledge the threshold crossed.
