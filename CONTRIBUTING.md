# Contributing to Mindset Dojo ⛩️🌿

Welcome to Mindset Dojo. This project is both technical and transformational, reflecting a deeper rhythm of inner practice, community learning, and social contribution. Contributing here means participating in an evolving dojo—not just a code repository.

## 🥋 Before You Contribute

We welcome:
- Suggestions via Issues
- Practice reflections and insights shared externally (e.g. Medium)
- Documentation, design, or structural improvements

**Pull Requests (PRs)** are open to all, but deeper integration happens through practice. Before taking on core roles or becoming a regular contributor, we ask that you first:

- Complete at least **Gray Belt level** in the [Mindset Dojo Program](https://dojo.center/program)
- Understand our rhythm, principles, and tone of engagement

This helps ensure alignment between our inner work and our outward contributions.

## 💡 Our Contribution Principles

- **Minimal by design** — Space is held for emergent agreements.
- **Human-first, Agile-friendly** — We value presence over process.
- **Conventional Commits** — Please use [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- **Open by invitation** — We value transparency, but also stewardship.

## Principles of Practice

In this dojo, our work is not just technical — it is a shared practice.  The following principles guide how we contribute and collaborate together:

- **Keep One Point** – Focus on a single intention at a time.  Each change, issue, or idea should be centered around one clear purpose.
- **Mind Moves Body** – Before writing code, state *why* the change matters.  A clear intention guides effective execution.
- **Relax Completely** – We assume good intent and offer calm, constructive feedback.  Reviews are a space for learning, not contest.
- **Keep Weight Underside** – Prefer small, steady improvements built on solid foundations.  We value simplicity and reversibility over heroic complexity.

### How We Review

Reviews are an extension of practice — a chance to grow together.  We aim to:
- respond with clarity and curiosity,
- offer specific suggestions rather than judgments,
- remain modest and open to being changed by another’s point of view.

### Joining the Community

If you’re new here, you’re welcome to reach out to an existing member when starting your first contribution.  There is no formal mentorship structure — simply a space for connection and shared learning.  Let the conversation grow naturally, and see what emerges.
