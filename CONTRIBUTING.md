## 🥋 Contributing to Mindset Dojo

Thank you for helping others cross the threshold from intention to action. Start small, stay reflective, and ship in short cycles.

### Contribution paths

- **Become an author (card + first Insight)** — add `_authors/<your-slug>.md` and include the full front matter template (layout, section key, mantra, program level, join date, signature, links, `about` block). Publish your first Insight under `_insights/<year>/<your-slug>/<date>-<title>.md` with the complete insight fields (`layout`, `title`, `title_mark`, `published_date`, `refactored_date`, `authors`, `forms`, `excerpt`). Share your practice in a reflective, actionable tone, then open a pull request.
- **Mission/docs** — improve onboarding docs (readme, mission-supporting pages) with a short rationale in your PR description.

### Review expectations

- Keep Markdown simple; favor lists and short paragraphs over heavy HTML.
- Use clear YAML front matter with `---` fences. Match the patterns in existing author cards and Insights.
- When editing layouts or includes, preserve existing section keys and front matter hooks unless your PR explains the change.

### Submission checklist

- Preview locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve` if possible, or rely on GitHub Pages build feedback after merge.
- Verify links and image paths if you include media.
- Confirm filenames and directories follow the expected slug/date patterns.

### Community norms

- Be direct, respectful, and helpful; we iterate and reflect like a dojo kata.
- Small, focused pull requests speed up review and publishing.
- The LICENSE applies to all contributions; by submitting a PR you agree to its terms.
