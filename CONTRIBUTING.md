## Contributing to Mindset Dojo ⛩️🌿

Welcome to [**Mindset Dojo**](https://mindset.dojo.center). This project is both technical and transformational, reflecting a deeper rhythm of *inner practice*, *community learning*, and *social contribution*. Contributing here means participating in an ***evolving dojo*** — not just a code repository.

## 🥋 Before You Contribute

We welcome:

* 💬 **Suggestions via issues**
* ✍️ *Practice reflections and insights* shared externally (e.g., [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), [Medium](https://medium.com/))
* 🧩 Documentation, design, or structural improvements

**Pull requests (PRs)** are open to all, but deeper integration happens through practice. Before taking on core roles or becoming a regular contributor, we ask that you first:

* Complete at least the ***Gray Level*** level in the [program](https://mindset.dojo.center/program)
* Understand our **rhythm**, **principles**, and **tone of engagement**

This helps ensure alignment between our inner work and our outward contributions.

## 💡 Principles of Practice

In this dojo, our work is not just technical — it is a *shared practice*. The following principles guide how we contribute and collaborate together:

* 🎯 **Focus & Clarity** — Aim each issue or change at a single, clear intention and keep work bite-sized. **Atomic, focused contributions** make learning and review easier.
* 🧭 **State Intention** — Say *why* you’re doing something before you do it. Provide a user story (*“As a contributor to Mindset Dojo, I want to Refactor the Site, so that I can have a better viewer experience”*) in the **Issue** or **Pull Request** description to reveal the value behind the change. A clear intention guides better execution and calibrated feedback.
* 🤝 **Calm, Human Reviews** — *Assume good intent* and give **specific**, **curious**, and **modest** feedback. Reviews are for learning together, not for scoring points.
* 🛡️ **Open Stewardship & Clear Trail** — Be transparent while respecting stewardship: welcome participation, let roles form through practice, and keep history readable (we use [***Conventional Commits***](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to help with that).

### ✅ How We Review

* **Respond with clarity and curiosity**
* **Offer specific suggestions rather than judgments**
* **Remain modest and open to being changed by another’s point of view**
* **Treat reviews as a shared opportunity for practice and growth**

### 🤝 Joining the Community

If you’re new here, you’re warmly encouraged to **reach out to an existing member** when starting your first contribution. While there is *no rigid or prescriptive mentorship program*, informal mentoring and peer pairing are **highly encouraged** — they reflect our Agile mindset of co-learning and shared stewardship. Let the connection form naturally and see what emerges.

## 🔄 Pull Request Guidance

1. **Fork** the repository and create a topic branch
2. Use [***Conventional Commits***](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in your messages
3. Submit a **clear, minimal pull request** and link any relevant issues
4. All pull requests are vetted through automated **GitHub Actions**–based quality gates

6. **Merges** happen through mutual discernment — both technical *and* energetic fit matter

### 🔀 Who Merges?

* **The initiator** should merge if they have permission
* **If the initiator lacks permission**, an approver should merge after confirming intention and review are complete
* **If build problems appear post-merge**, reach out to **Trusted Committers, Project Maintainers, or Organizational Owners** — ideally whoever has the *most context* about the change
