  Mindset Dojo explores why well-intended strategic change efforts often stall —
  even when the goals are clear, the incentives are aligned, and the people involved
  are capable and motivated.

  Over time, patterns form.
  They shape how decisions are made, how risk is handled, and how change is absorbed.
  When those patterns remain unseen, change slows or fractures.
  When they are recognized and worked with, movement becomes possible again.

  This work is currently being re-formed into a small set of applied patterns,
  presented through a narrative format inspired by *The Goal*,
  *Fearless Change*, and real-world adoption efforts.

  That work is not yet published.

  If you are navigating a situation where strategic change feels stuck
  and want to think it through with someone grounded in this domain,
  you’re welcome to reach out.
