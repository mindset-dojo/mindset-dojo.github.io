  Mindset Dojo is a collaborative research lab for mindset, behavior,
  and presence — a living open-source book you can read, fork, and
  contribute to. It runs on GitHub Pages, and the community can help
  you get started if GitHub is new to you.

  In fast, confusing, or high-pressure moments — especially in today’s
  AI-accelerated world — mindset determines how much agency you have.
  Small, consistent practices make the biggest difference.

        One of the most effective habits I've found, in teams and in life,
        is a weekly reflection shared openly. It costs nothing, builds
        clarity, strengthens culture, and pairs beautifully with modern AI.

        With the help of key contributors, who are the first authors,
        I open-sourced this work because getting started alone is hard.
        Here, authorship is collaborative. You're invited to explore,
        reflect, and contribute at your own pace.
