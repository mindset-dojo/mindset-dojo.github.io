  Mindset Dojo trains a single capability:
  Continuous Discernment — the ability to stay clear, connected, and grounded
  in an AI-accelerated world.

  Continuous Discernment strengthens your inner models so external ones—AI
  systems, algorithmic influence loops, and social hierarchies—can't silently
  steer your perception or decision-making.

  This is high-precision, human-to-human practice. You train with real partners
  in real conversations, building clarity, timing, and presence under social
  and technical load.

  The dojo is for professionals who value real mentorship: practitioners
  refining their craft, technologists sharpening judgment, and emerging
  leaders learning to stay human in fast-moving environments.
