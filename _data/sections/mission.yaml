mantra: "Continuous Discernment"
mantra_mark: "Discernment"
description: |
  People want to stop living inside patterns they didn’t choose.
  
  Patterns shape perception. Perception shapes behavior. Behavior shapes
  outcomes. And most of that happens long before conscious choice appears.
  
  Mindset Dojo trains one capability: Continuous Discernment — the skill
  of noticing patterns as they arise, interrupting the ones that limit you,
  and re-patterning toward clarity, agency, and grounded action.
  
  This isn’t theoretical. Patterns live in the body: reflexes, tensions,
  impulses, habits, emotional signatures, narrative loops. Repatterning
  requires awareness, honesty, and embodied practice — not willpower.
  
  The training helps you see clearly:
  
  - the patterns shaping you,
  - the patterns shaping groups,
  - the patterns shaping modern AI systems.
  
  Narrative follows pattern, not the other way around. When you shift
  the underlying pattern, your story, behavior, and possibilities shift too.
  
  Pattern literacy increases agency. With new ways of seeing, you unlock
  new ways of directing your energy — socially, emotionally, technically,
  and creatively.
  
  This dojo is an open-source project. We document what we discover,
  test it in real conversations and embodied practice, and refine our
  understanding together. Open-source patterns create open-source
  possibility.
  
  Crossing the threshold is voluntary — and irreversible. Once you see
  patterns clearly, you don’t unsee them.
