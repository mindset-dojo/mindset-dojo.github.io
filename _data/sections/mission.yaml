mantra: "Continuous Agency"
mantra_mark: "Agency"
description: |
  Mindset Dojo trains one core capability: Continuous Agency — the skill of
  recognizing patterns as they arise and shifting them before they shape your
  choices. Patterns shape perception. Perception shapes behavior. Behavior
  shapes outcomes. Most of this happens before you’re aware of it.

  Continuous Agency gives you back the moment-to-moment freedom that old
  habits, group dynamics, and AI-driven suggestion loops quietly erode. When
  you see the pattern, you regain the choice. When you shift the pattern, you
  shift the outcome.

  This training is embodied, not theoretical. Patterns live in reflexes,
  tensions, emotions, impulses, narratives, and relational fields. Repatterning
  requires awareness, honesty, and practice — not willpower.

  Mindset Dojo is an open-source project. We document what we learn, test it in
  live conversation and embodied drills, and refine our understanding together.
  Open-source patterns create open-source possibility.

  Crossing the threshold is voluntary — and irreversible. Once you see
  patterns clearly, you don’t unsee them.
