mantra: "Pattern Agency"
mantra_mark: "Agency"
description: |
  Your behavior has a runtime. Most people never inspect it.

  Patterns are your defaults — fast, automatic responses that fire before your
  thinking mind is online. They shape your tone, timing, and stance in real
  situations long before you consciously choose.

  This isn't psychology. It's real-time systems behavior. If you don’t
  understand your defaults, your defaults control you.

  Mindset Dojo trains one capability: Pattern Agency — the skill of seeing
  your patterns as they execute and reclaiming the decision window instead of
  letting momentum make the call.

  Mindset Dojo is also an open-source book. Every practitioner becomes a
  contributor. Your reflections — wins, misses, adjustments — are commits
  that update your own behavioral runtime and add to the shared record of
  this community.

  You train where it actually counts: real conversations, incident bridges,
  conflict moments, and high-pressure interactions. No theory. No
  motivational fluff. Just reps, signal clarity, and honest feedback loops.

  Once you can read your own runtime, unintentional behavior stops being an
  acceptable default — and you’re ready to author your part of the book.
