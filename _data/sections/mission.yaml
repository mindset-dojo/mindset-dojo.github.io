  Mindset Dojo is a collaborative research lab for mindset, behavior,
  and presence — a living open-source book you can read, fork, and
  contribute to. It runs on GitHub Pages, and the community can help
  you get started if GitHub is new to you.

  In fast, uncertain, or high-pressure moments — especially in today’s
  AI-accelerated world — mindset determines how much agency you have. A
  small shift in awareness can change how you navigate conflict,
  relationships, leadership, or complex work.

  This project is open-source because mindset work becomes more
  effective when it’s transparent, collaborative, and shared. The book
  is built from real reflections, experiments, and practice logs — a
  living dataset of how people grow, adapt, and show up under pressure.

        Weekly reflection is one of the simplest, most effective habits I've
        found. It costs nothing, builds clarity, and pairs beautifully with
        modern AI.

        With the help of key contributors, we open-sourced this work so no one
        has to start alone.
