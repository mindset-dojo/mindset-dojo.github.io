meta: Patterns for unlocking strategic change
description: |
  Mindset Dojo is a body of work focused on why strategic change efforts get stuck —
  and how they begin to unlock when underlying patterns of behavior, attention,
  and interaction become visible.

  This work draws on lived experience inside real organizational change,
  as well as pattern-based approaches to adoption and integration.

  The next evolution of this work is being shaped into a compact, narrative form.
