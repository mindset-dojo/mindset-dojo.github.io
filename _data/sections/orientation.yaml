meta: Orientation to the Mindset Dojo community and practice
description: |
  People in the Mindset Dojo community believe principles matter most under pressure — and that the mind can be trained to return to those principles when we drift.

  At its core is a simple belief:  
  when we train how we relate to pressure, tension, and uncertainty, we show up more in line with our principles — more often, and more sustainably.

  People participate here in different ways:

  - Some reflect and share their thinking in the open authorship commons  
  - Some join conversation circles to explore what they’re noticing together  
  - Some apply mindset training, tools, and lenses that support awareness and flexibility in difficult situations  

  This work shows up across many contexts — leadership, technology, martial arts, family, friendships, and personal practice.

  You don’t need to know where you fit to begin.  
  You’re welcome to explore, or reach out if you’d like to understand how this might apply in your world.
