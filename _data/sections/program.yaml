mantra: "Don't Resist. Resonate."
mantra_mark: "Resonate."
description: |
  A layered training journey — presence, nervous-system skill, and
  conversational leadership applied in real contexts. Each level functions
  like a zone in a training game, gradually increasing your capacity to stay
  connected and responsive under pressure. This is the inverse of distancing:
  training resonance instead of resistance.
