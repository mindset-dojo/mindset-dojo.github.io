meta: Principles-first mindset training under pressure
description: |
  This page primarily serves people who are actively training, and is shared publicly to provide context for how the practice works.

  Some people here choose to train more deliberately, developing their capacity to stay oriented to principles when pressure and tension increase. The training method offers structured ways to explore this relationship over time — strengthening awareness, flexibility, tone, and situational stance through repeated practice rather than conceptual understanding alone.

  If you’d like more context about the training or how it’s used in practice, feel free to reach out.
