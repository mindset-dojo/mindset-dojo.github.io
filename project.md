## Open Source Infrastructure

The Mindset Dojo infrastructure is built as an [Open Source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) project, which means anyone can see how it works, suggest improvements, and even contribute directly. Our project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a platform where communities collaborate to build software together.

This approach makes our work transparent, collaborative, and always evolving with input from the wider community. If you’re not technical, think of it like a public workshop where anyone can walk in, see what’s being built, and lend a hand.

## 🥋 Before You Contribute

Everyone is welcome to contribute to Mindset Dojo.  
You don’t have to be a coder — contributions can be as simple as:

* 💬 Sharing **suggestions** in our GitHub issues  
* ✍️ Writing about your **practice reflections and insights** on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) or [Medium](https://medium.com/)  
* 🧩 Helping with **design, writing, or small improvements** to the site  

If you’d like to go deeper — taking on bigger roles or regular contributions — we invite you to first:

* Explore at least the ***Gray Level*** of the [program](https://mindset.dojo.center/program)  
* Get a feel for our **rhythm, principles, and tone**  

This keeps our inner practice aligned with what we create together.

## 💡 Principles of Practice

In this dojo, contributing is not only about building a website — it is about *shared practice*.  
Here are the principles we keep close:

* 🎯 **Keep it simple and clear** — Focus each change on one thing at a time. Small, clear steps are easier to learn from.  
* 🧭 **Share your intention** — Let others know *why* you’re doing something. A short note like “I’m updating the menu so it’s easier to navigate” helps everyone understand the value.  
* 🤝 **Review with kindness** — Assume good intent. Be specific, curious, and respectful in feedback. Reviews are for learning together.  
* 🛡️ **Work openly** — Be transparent, welcome others in, and keep changes easy to follow. We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to keep history clear.  

### ✅ How We Review

* Respond with clarity and curiosity  
* Offer suggestions, not judgments  
* Stay open to learning from each other  
* Treat reviews as shared practice  

### 🤝 Joining the Community

If you’re new, don’t worry — you don’t have to figure it out alone.  
Reach out to a member when making your first contribution. There’s no formal mentorship program, but informal support and pairing are common here. We learn and grow together.

## 🔄 Pull Request Guidance

When you’re ready to share a change, here’s how to do it:

1. **Make your own copy** of the project (a “fork”) and work on a new branch.  
2. Write commit messages using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) — this just means keeping them short and clear.  
3. Submit a **pull request (PR)** with your change, linking to any related issue.  
4. Automated checks will run to make sure nothing is broken.  
5. Community members may review or refine your PR.  
6. **Merging** is a shared decision — we look at both the technical and the energetic fit of your change.  

### 🔀 Who Merges?

* If you have permission, you can merge your own PR after review.  
* If you don’t, someone with approval will merge it for you once it’s ready.  
* If problems show up after merging, reach out to a community maintainer — ideally the person with the most context about the change.
