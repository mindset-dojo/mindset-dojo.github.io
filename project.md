<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<hr>

## Open Source Infrastructure
The [Site]({{'/' | relative_url}}) is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a platform where communities build and improve software together in the open.

The Mindset Dojo infrastructure is built as an [Open Source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) project, which means anyone can see how it works, suggest improvements, and even contribute directly.

We’ve released the Mindset Dojo site under an **Open Source [License]({{'/LICENSE' | relative_url}})**, which simply means the code and content is shared freely for anyone to learn from, use, or improve with proper attribution — much like leaving the workshop door open so the whole community can join in.

## 🥋 Before You Contribute
  
You don’t have to be technically savvy — contributions can be as simple as:

* 💬 Sharing **suggestions** in our GitHub [Issues]({{site.repo_url}}/issues)  
* ✍️ Writing about your **practice reflections and insights** on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) or [Medium](https://medium.com/)  
* 🧩 Helping with **design, writing, or small improvements** to the site  

If you’d like to go deeper — stepping into leadership opportunities or regular contributions — we invite you to first:

* Explore at least the ***Gray Level*** of the [Program]({{'/program' | relative_url}})  
* Get a feel for our **rhythm, principles, and tone**  

This keeps our inner practice aligned with what we create together.

Contributions are always welcome and voluntary — and just as kindly, the community may choose which ones to accept, keeping the spirit and direction of the dojo in harmony.

## 💡 Principles of Practice

In this dojo, contributing is not only about building a site — it is about *shared practice*.  
Here are the principles we keep close:

* 🎯 **Keep it simple and clear** — Focus each change on one thing at a time. Small, clear steps are easier to learn from.  
* 🧭 **Share your intention** — Let others know *why* you’re doing something. A short note like “I’m updating the menu so it’s easier to navigate” helps everyone understand the value.  
* 🤝 **Review with kindness** — Assume good intent. Be specific, curious, and respectful in feedback. Reviews are for learning together.  
* 🛡️ **Work openly** — Be transparent, welcome others in, and keep changes easy to follow. We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep history clear.  

### ✅ How We Review

* Respond with clarity and curiosity  
* Offer suggestions, not judgments  
* Stay open to learning from each other  
* Treat reviews as shared practice  

### 🤝 Joining the Community

If you’re new, don’t worry — you don’t have to figure it out alone. Reach out to a member when making your first contribution. There’s no formal mentorship program, but informal support and pairing are common here. We learn and grow together.
