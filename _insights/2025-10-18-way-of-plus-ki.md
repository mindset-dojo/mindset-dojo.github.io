excerpt: "When the mind empties, body and universe become one — this is Plus Ki."
---

A student once asked,  
“Master, how do I find the flow?”  

The master poured tea into a cup — and kept pouring.  
Hot liquid spilled over the edge, scalding the student’s hand.  

“When the cup is full,” said the master,  
“there is no flow.  
When you are full of yourself,  
there is no Ki.”  

The student bowed.  
He had lived like this cup —  
filled with effort, driven to control,  
pouring more doing into every still moment.  

“Then what is Plus Ki?” he asked.  

The master set down the pot.  
“When the cup empties, tea and air become one.  
When the mind empties, body and universe become one.  
This is Plus Ki.”  

The words fell into silence,  
like a breath released after holding too long.  

He felt something shift —  
the push of the Driver giving way to the calm of the Visionary,  
the order of the Organizer softening into the warmth of the Collaborator.  
Control dissolved into connection.  

In that moment, he no longer chased flow —  
he became it.  

The master’s stillness was not absence of energy,  
but balance — the quiet pulse of all energies moving as one.  
That harmony was not taught; it was felt.  
It was resonance.  

The student breathed.  
The rising steam no longer burned; it danced.  

He understood.  
To act with Plus Ki is not to add power,
but to let go.

**Relax completely. Keep one point. Extend Ki.**  
When these are one, The Way opens by itself.  

Not a path to find,  
but a current to remember.  

The question is never,  
“How do I find The Way?”  

The question is —  
can you empty your cup  
and let the universe move through you?
