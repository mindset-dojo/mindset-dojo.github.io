excerpt: "Through Blue Belt training, I learned that Fearless Leadership begins not with control, but with the awareness to lead, follow, and act through balance."
---

Before Blue Belt training, I often approached conversations passively — following a mental script, reacting rather than leading.

Since training, I’ve developed greater awareness and intention. I now enter conversations with a direction in mind and use Driver energy to move them forward. I’m not just participating; I’m steering.

### Leading by Following

At the same time, I’ve learned to better integrate others into the dialogue using Collaborator energy.

A key moment came while working on the Mindset Dojo site alongside the Sensei. I practiced servant leadership by consciously following his lead — recognizing his deeper experience in software engineering and with the program itself.

Instead of trying to control the direction, I stepped back, supported his vision, and worked to amplify it. That shift allowed us to build momentum as a team and reminded me that leading sometimes means knowing when to follow.

### The Contagion of Mindset

One of the most impactful insights from Blue Belt is how contagious mindsets are.

I’ve seen how negativity can warp perception — not only in others, but in myself. Recognizing that, I’ve started checking my internal tone and shifting conversations away from spirals by reframing challenges as opportunities.

This awareness has helped me keep both myself and others aligned with a constructive mindset.

### Confronting My Overreliance on Visionary Energy

A major area of growth has been addressing my tendency to live too much in the Visionary space — planning, imagining, strategizing — without always taking decisive action.

That imbalance became clear during the Mindset Dojo project. At multiple points, I hit a wall of inertia. Each time, the Sensei would “draw a door” — forcing me to make a choice: stay stuck, or step through. There was no middle ground.

Those moments were uncomfortable, but essential. Over time, stepping through became easier. The emotional resistance lessened. I started to act with less hesitation and more commitment.

### Balancing Mind and Body

This repeated experience revealed a deeper imbalance — not just between energies, but between mind and body.

While I can explain the Zen Leader Essential Flips and the 9 Negotiation Moves intellectually, I haven’t yet embodied them.

I’ve begun the work — writing user stories, meditating, practicing breathwork — but I know I still default to the mind. The body work is where I have the most room to grow.

### Looking Ahead

I’m not at Black Belt yet. I don’t fully embody the values and practices taught in Mindset Dojo.

But I now understand what the path looks like. I’ve taken the first real steps — through action, not just reflection.

Going forward, I’ll continue building these habits: journaling reflections on user story work, meditating regularly, and saying “yes” when the Sensei draws the next door.
