excerpt: "At ZLOTC, I discovered that every act of teaching is also an act of learning — when we reflect, allow, and connect, Ki extends, and the circle becomes a spiral."

Recently, Michael Basil and I presented at [**ZLOTC (Zen Leader Off the Cushion)**](https://zenleader.global/zlotc-registration), hosted by the [**Institute for Zen Leadership**](https://zenleader.global/).
Our topic: *Meta Energy*, *Elemental FEBI*, and the *Essential Flip — From Controlling to Connecting*.

We had fun, yes—but the true lesson revealed itself only afterward. The ZLOTC community learned from us, but I found myself being flipped in return.

The first Flip was **From Reaction to Reflection.**
This one came not from Zen, but from our own.
[Jeremy McMillian]({{'/authors/jeremy-mcmillan/' | relative_url}})—Aikido black belt, Site Reliability Engineer, and wise hermit-sage—once told me:

> “If you’re stuck with something in Zen, sit with it until it makes sense, instead of reacting.”

That advice prepared me for ZLOTC’s deliberate pace—so different from the rapid, technical rhythm of **Cloud Security Office Hours**.
It echoed Ginny Whitelaw’s Flip *From Driving Results to Attracting Commitment*—a move from forcing outcomes to *creating space* where understanding arises. Reflection is that space.

The second Flip, **From Let Go to Allow**, came from Paul Sevett.
He shared that in meditation, “letting go” felt binary—either holding or not holding.
But *allowing* was a gradient, a continuum of relaxation, like breath deepening without command.
This mirrors the Flip *From Tension to Extension* in *The Zen Leader*: when Ki extends naturally, control dissolves into flow.
As Koichi Tohei wrote, *“Relax completely, and you will know that Ki is extending.”*
Allowing is how Ki moves through stillness.

The third Flip, **From Me to We**, came from Maureen Murphy.
She spoke of breaking silos in healthcare, where specialization divides people like languages that cannot translate.
In that, I saw Agile and DevOps—different fields, same spirit—moving *from isolated mastery to collective flow*.
It was the Flip *From Local Self to Whole Self*: seeing through separation into the system’s wholeness.
When we shift from “my project” to “our ecosystem,” connection becomes the Way.

These Flips reminded me of Tohei Sensei’s principle: *“Mind moves body.”*
When we react, cling, or isolate, Ki collapses inward.
When we reflect, allow, and connect, Ki extends outward—toward others, toward the Universal.
In *Ki in Daily Life*, he writes, *“Be both pupil and instructor.”*
Teaching and learning are not two things—they are one flow of Ki returning upon itself.

So perhaps the truest Flip I learned at ZLOTC was this:

> From Teaching to Learning — From Circle to Spiral.

And in that movement, control dissolves into connection.
Teacher and student, self and other, individual and Universal—each are one Ki extending.
