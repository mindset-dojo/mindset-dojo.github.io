excerpt: In a household filled with the energy of LEGO bricks and playful disagreements, a simple conflict becomes a lesson in collaboration. When we listen to each other’s underlying needs and match our approaches, we unlock the power of different energies — Organizer, Driver, Visionary, and Collaborator — creating space for connection and sweet solutions.

Once upon a weekday, in a house with drawings on the fridge and LEGO bricks underfoot, a small disagreement was brewing.

 "I should go first," said Jack, calculating quickly.
 "No!" said Lila. "You shall not pass!"

They stood eye to eye like two tiny titans — one full of strategy, the other full of spark.

Their dad stepped in, not to settle the fight, but to sense the flow.

"Hmm," he said. "Organizer wants a plan.  Driver wants to win. What if we check whos in what pattern… and match before we move?"

Jack raised an eyebrow. "Im kind of in Organizer-Visionary mode. Ive got a plan and an idea."

Lila crossed her arms. "Im in full Driver.  With a little Collaborator, maybe. "

Just then, their mom walked in — calm, observing, emotionally attuned.
She said nothing, but gave Lila a knowing look. It was the kind of look that says,
I know how to reach you when words wont work.

Lila sighed. "Fine. But only if I get the sparkly plate."

Later that week, they were out at a bakery. The cupcake case was nearly empty.

Their dad leaned in, spoke kindly to the baker, pointed to a lonesome one in the corner, and somehow — without paying — walked away with a perfectly wrapped cupcake.

"See?" whispered Lila. "Dad has the negotiating superpower."
"Driver + Visionary + Collaborator," Jack whispered back.
"With a sprinkle of Organizer," added their mom.

And all four energies, it turns out, made a sweet deal.

> Moral of the fable: Everyone has all four energies. But its how we listen, match, and shift between them — together — that makes the magic.
