excerpt: "Reflection on 'trust' in the 'Circle' Mindset form."
---

[Circle](../../forms/circle/) is introduced in the gray level training from the Mindset Dojo. "Trust" as a concept is mentioned several times as core to the circle, and so I thought I would examine the idea of trust.

The modern concept of trust in society is generally defined as a belief or confidence that another person, group, or institution will act in a reliable, honest, and beneficial manner. It involves a willingness of the "trustor" to be vulnerable to the actions of the "trustee," expecting that the trustee will act with integrity and in ways that benefit or do not harm the trustor, even though the trustor cannot control the trustee's actions. Trust reduces social complexity by allowing individuals to rely on others without constantly doubting their intentions or outcomes, facilitating cooperation and social cohesion.

Trust is essential in personal relationships, business dealings, and governance, acting as a form of social glue.

While investigating the concept of trust I found out that the ancient Greek word for trust is more complex and nuanced.

The ancient Greek word for trust, Πειθώ (Peithō), means "persuasion" or "winning eloquence." It is both a common noun and a personified goddess in Greek mythology representing persuasion, charming speech, and seduction. Peitho embodied both sexual and political persuasion and played a significant role in social and civic harmony, particularly in Athens and Argos.

Peitho's significance extended beyond mythology to practical and cultural aspects of Greek life. She was involved in marriage negotiations where a suitor would persuade the guardian for a bride's hand, underscoring the importance of persuasive skill. She was also a symbol of civic unity, credited with helping establish democratic spirit and cooperation in Athens as well as harmony within interpersonal relationships like marriage.

Despite her positive aspects, Peitho's power of persuasion could also be destructive when used selfishly, as in myths where persuasion led to tragic consequences.

In the famous Judgment of Paris myth, Peithō aided Aphrodite in persuading Paris to award Aphrodite the golden apple over Hera and Athena. This persuasion led to Paris abducting Helen, sparking the Trojan War. Peithō’s powers were instrumental in tipping the scales in Aphrodite’s favor.

Peithō was critical in the marriage of Thetis and Peleus, which led to an uneasy alliance between human and goddess, leading to the birth of Achilles who would die tragically in the same Trojan War.

Peithō was also central in the trust that led to the relationship of Aphrodite and Adonis, a mortal. This led to jealous ire of the gods and the tragic death of Adonis.

So while trust is critical to our individual and social frameworks, trust can be linked closely to unfounded persuasion. The methods of persuasion can be founded on credible information, but can also be founded on lies and appeals to emotion. Because of this, trust has to be a concept that is continuously revisited when applied to your own life.

Engage with the Dojo to join a circle and explore the concept of trust.
