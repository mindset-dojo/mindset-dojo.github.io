excerpt: "Through Red Level training, I learned that Energy Agility must be embodied, not merely understood."
---

Crossing the Red Level Threshold felt less like earning a rank and more like finishing a marathon—messy, humbling, and full of shadow work I didn’t expect. Working with the Sensei on the Zen Leader Off the Cushion presentation dragged old patterns into the light, sometimes pulling us both below the line. And just when I thought I’d recovered, the Community’s Alpha Threshold asked even more.

When my Driver burned out, I slid back into Visionary-Organizer—structured, familiar, but not actually restorative. The Sensei kept pointing me toward a Visionary-Collaborator stance instead: What future becomes possible when I stop trying to control it and let people in?

That question led me back to Zazen. Fifteen minutes at a time, I learned how to soften the mind’s grip. The calm didn’t stay on the cushion; it opened space in my day, making me more empathetic, more present. Training through Form-making with the Sensei reinforced the same lesson: Forms that aren’t tied to lived experience don’t resonate. Embodiment isn’t optional; it’s the whole point.

From this phase, one truth distilled sharply: I had been avoiding energies and situations that weren’t comfortable or entertaining. When discomfort appeared, I tried to “force Driver,” which only pushed Driver below the line. Instead, I’m practicing the Sensei’s method—letting the future-me-as-Collaborator shape the moment rather than resisting it.

There are still edges. I lack true Energy Agility. Shifting into Visionary-Collaborator to recharge my Driver takes conscious effort, as does sustaining Collaborator-Organizer when reviewing pull requests as a DevOps Cultivator. I intend to grow these capacities and expand my Zazen to 30 minutes a day to deepen my connection with Chosei Zen.

As I move to the next level, integrating what I’d been repressing shows me where to train next: deeper Heart, deeper Hara, turning Insight into reflex. What becomes possible—both for me and for those I train with—is a field of presence that invites connection rather than demands it. And through that resonance, Mindset Dojo grows not by strategy, but by the quiet gravity of people becoming more whole together.
