excerpt: "Through Red Level training, I learned that Energy Agility must be embodied, not merely understood."
---

My experience passing the Red Level Threshold was that it was like running a marathon. The shadow work I had to do to work with the Sensei for the Zen Leader Off The Cushion presentation was very difficult, and at times led to us getting below the line. Afterwards, completing the Community's Alpha Threshold took even more work. When my Driver is exhausted, I retreat back to Visionary-Organizer but I notice that it doesn't truly help me relax. The Sensei is inviting me to shift to an Visionary-Collaborator Stance since connection is generally Plus Ki.

What shifted in my practice is that I started meditating through Zazen. I managed to get up to 15 minutes of Zazen before I got too distracted to continue. I noticed an improval in my mental state after meditation, being more calm and less attached to the mind. My mind is more open and empathetic than it used to be because of my training.

What I learned from Form based training, mainly making a lot of the Forms and storming with the Sensei during making those Forms, is that if they aren't connected to your lived experience, then you aren't merely mentally masturbating, you are fucking with people's lives. Thus, there is no Form that is not embodied in some way.

What was distilled from the previous phase was my tendency to avoid connecting with energies and situations I didn't like or wasn't entertained by. Before, I tried to force Driver, resulting in it being below the line, to be present. In the future, I plan on mirroring the Sensei's approach by living the future of me being a Collaborator in that moment.

The gaps and edges that remain and how I intend to relate to them is that I still lack embodiment of Energy Agility, and I intend to train to be able to shift into Visionary-Collaborator more easily when recharging my Driver as well as shifting into and sustaining Collaborator-Organizer when dealing with Pull Requests as a DevOps Cultivator. I also plan on increasing my Zazen practice to 30 minutes a day so that I can network better with Chosei Zen.

As I move into the next level, I am more integrated with my Shadow making me realize that I must train deeper in the Heart and Hara to embody my Insight into reflex. What becomes possible for me — and for those I train with — is deeper presence and thus deeper connection, attracting more people to Mindset Dojo through our tuned resonance.
