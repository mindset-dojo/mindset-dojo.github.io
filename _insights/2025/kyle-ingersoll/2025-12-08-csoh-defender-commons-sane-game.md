## Introduction

As long term participants in Cloud Security Office Hours (CSOH), we ([Kyle Ingersoll](../../authors/kyle-ingersoll/) and [Michael Basil](../../authors/michael-basil/)) were asked to give a session about the fundamentals of Open Source and GitHub.

We accepted, and decided that instead of writing a reflection article afterwards, we use the article itself as the collaboration vehicle. Through distilled quotes, the CSOH community's personalities and passion can shine through.

Prompts for the reflection include:

- Why I come to Cloud Security Office Hours
- Why others might consider joining
- A contribution I’m imagining for next year
