## Introduction

As long term participants in Cloud Security Office Hours, [Kyle Ingersoll](../../authors/kyle-ingersoll/) and [Michael Basil](../../authors/michael-basil/) were asked to give a session about the fundamentals of Open Source and GitHub.

They accepted, and decided that instead of writing a reflection article afterwards, they would use the article itself as the collaboration vehicle. Through distilled quotes, the CSOH community's personalities and passion can shine through.

Prompts for the quotes include:

- Why I come to Cloud Security Office Hours
- Why others might consider joining
- A contribution I’m imagining for next year
