excerpt: Cloud Security Office Hours is a rare space where cloud defenders can be honest about the pressures of the “Gilded Labyrinth,” learn from each other, and quietly explore more grounded, sustainable ways of doing this work together.

## Introduction by Kyle Ingersoll

Cloud Security Office Hours feels like a strange and precious thing in cybersecurity:
a place where people who live deep inside the **Gilded Labyrinth** can finally tell the truth.

Most weeks, it feels a bit like group therapy for cloud defenders.
Not the glossy wellness kind—more like a quiet, slightly exhausted circle of people who know the incentives are often misaligned, the alerts never stop, and the stakes are uncomfortably real. We log in from big companies, consultancies, startups, and public-sector roles, and for an hour or two we say the things that are hard to say in a ticket or a status report:

> “This is burning me out.”
> “This doesn’t make sense.”
> “I’m trying to do the right thing in a system that wasn’t designed with us in mind.”

That honesty alone would be enough reason to show up. But what I love most is that CSOH doesn’t stop at venting. The community leaders bring deep technical skill, humility, and a real willingness to say “I don’t know” out loud. People share incident stories, weird edge cases, career forks, and the small, practical tricks they’ve found for staying effective (and at least somewhat sane) while the backlog keeps growing.

In that sense, CSOH is a **pressure relief valve** for life in the Gilded Labyrinth. It gives us language, perspective, and solidarity so we can go back to our day jobs a little more grounded and a little less alone.

But there’s another layer I appreciate: CSOH also feels like a *bridge* between the Gilded Labyrinth and what I think of as the **Rooted Orchard**—a more grounded way of doing security and life, built on craft, community, and defending real people rather than just chasing metrics. In CSOH, I meet people who are brilliant at navigating complex cloud environments and who also quietly care about building healthier teams, mentoring the next generation, and finding more sustainable paths for themselves.

That’s what I love most: the quiet possibility that this “therapy circle” is also a **scouting party**. A place where we can be honest about what’s hard, learn from each other, and slowly sketch out better ways of doing this work—ways that keep us rooted, not just successful.
