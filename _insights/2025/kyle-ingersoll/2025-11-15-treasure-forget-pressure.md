excerpt: “Under pressure, my mind shrank until even a priceless gift looked ordinary—only when gratitude returned did I see the treasure I nearly traded away.”
---

Yesterday, I nearly traded a treasure for a trinket.

The offer came wrapped in urgency — “act now,” “secure your spot,” “don’t miss your chance.”
Under that pressure, something subtle happened inside me: my mind shrank.
And when the mind becomes small, even what is priceless appears ordinary.

I told Sensei about the offer.
He bristled — insulted, hurt — and the air between us tightened.
We collided, not as enemies, but as two people briefly unable to see each other.

I knew of his DevOps lineage.
I *knew* he had led transformations at SAP, that he had roots reaching back to the Dojo Consortium.
But knowing is one thing.
Remembering is another.
And feeling it in your bones, in the moment pressure closes around you — that is something else entirely.

Why is it that intellect survives pressure, but gratitude doesn’t?
Why does fear shrink the mind until facts remain, yet their meaning vanishes?
Why do we forget the value of what we did not pay dearly to receive?

As we argued, something shifted.
Sensei realized I wasn’t being ungrateful — I was being *small*.
My awareness had collapsed, and with it, my memory of what I already had.
And I realized something too: I had almost thrown away a path offered as Ki-giving — a donation of mentorship, lineage, and presence — for something I mistook as “valuable” simply because it carried a price tag and a deadline.

When pressure subsided, my mind expanded again.
And in that larger mind, gratitude returned like breath after being held too long.

So the question remains:

**When urgency grips you, what treasure do you forget?**
**And how do you train to remember before loss becomes your teacher?**

---

**Practice:**
The next time something “urgent” appears, pause.
Feel your field contract — breath shallow, vision narrow, Driver pushing, Organizer trembling.
Ask one quiet question:

**“If my mind were larger, what would I already know?”**

Let that remembering guide you back to the treasure already in your hands.
