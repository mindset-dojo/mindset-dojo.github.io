excerpt: "A reflection on how the Mat Sessions and community practice of Mindset Dojo helped me transform ego-driven self-improvement into humble, fearless growth through beginner’s mind."
---

When I first came into **Mindset Dojo**, I carried a lot of good energy. I’ve always had that when engaging with community. But I’ll admit — I was also a bit **egotistical**. I thought I knew my shadow, but on another level I was completely blind to it.

Because I didn’t have a **beginner’s mindset**, I sometimes convinced myself I already knew enough. In Zen, they say to always keep a beginner’s mind — because the moment you think you know everything, you stop improving. That was me: eager, visionary, driven, but not fully open.

### Turning Reflection Into Reflex

Long before joining, I had already turned **reflection into reflex**. I was deeply introspective, focused on self-improvement, and always striving to be a better person. But even with all that, I didn’t have a mentor or guide to help me see the **path of self-improvement** more clearly.

That’s why **Mindset Dojo means so much to me**.

### A Structure for Growth

Here, I’ve found both **structure and intention**. The rhythm of our Mat Sessions — arrival, centering, breathing, flows, and reflection — grounds my energy and gives me a framework to keep growing.

The **breathing and stillness practices** in particular have helped me slow down, focus, and connect with what matters most.

### Conversations That Matter

Most importantly, the Dojo has given me a community where **deep, sustained conversations** are the norm. These dialogues are the practice ground for the conversations that matter most in life.

As the community has matured, our meetups have become more **intentional**, more **focused**, and more **powerful**.

### A Shared Journey

There’s always room for improvement, but I truly believe we’re off to a great start. For me, the Dojo isn’t just a community — it’s a guide, a mirror, and a shared journey.

If you’re looking for a place to grow, to connect, and to strengthen your ability to lead meaningful conversations, I invite you to join us.
