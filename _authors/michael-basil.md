  ### Pattern-Led Architect, Advisor & Author
  
  I never expected taming parrots and navigating soccer scrums to prepare me for the world of identity, architecture, and human systems. Looking back, it makes perfect sense.
  
  Growing up in my mom’s parrot shop, I learned to sense tension, trust, and edge-states by calming unruly macaws through relaxation rather than force. On the soccer pitch, I learned to move inside dynamic systems by reading flow, shifting rhythm, and adjusting position to keep the field coherent.
  
  With a computer engineering degree from the University of Illinois, I carried that same pattern-led approach into large-scale systems—from identity innovation with a U.S. patent filing to DevSecOps modernization, enterprise software, and organizational transformation. Along the way, I discovered that the hardest problems in technology and leadership are rarely technical. They’re complexity problems involving misaligned identities, unclear or assumed boundaries, incoherent roles, unspoken tension, and narratives that distort under load.
  
  Mindset Dojo emerged as an open-source human-systems project exploring what happens at the edges: nervous-system readiness, identity drift, relational gaps, and decision-making under pressure. It serves as a laboratory for understanding how people and systems break, adapt, and realign.
  
  Today I operate at the intersection of digital identity and human identity—where access, trust, and clarity matter most. I work with individuals and teams navigating high-stakes environments where technical systems, human systems, and growth demands converge.
  
  If you’re building something meaningful and find yourself at an inflection point—where alignment and coherent identity determine what becomes possible next—let’s talk.
