  ### Technology, Language, and Leadership
  
  I never expected taming parrots and navigating soccer scrums to prepare me for work in technology transformation and human systems. Looking back, it makes perfect sense.
  
  Growing up in my mom’s parrot shop, I learned to sense tension, trust, and edge-states by calming unruly macaws through presence rather than force. On the soccer pitch, I learned how systems stay coherent or fall apart based on rhythm, position, and shared direction.
  
  With a computer engineering degree from the University of Illinois, I carried that pattern awareness into digital identity, secure DevOps, enterprise platforms, and organizational transformation. Over time, a consistent pattern emerged: the hardest problems in technology and leadership are rarely technical. They arise when the language shaping decisions, roles, and relationships loses coherence under pressure.
  
  Mindset Dojo emerged from this inquiry as an open-source practice-ground exploring the language beneath our conversations. It is a place to study how people and systems break, adapt, and realign when the stakes are high.
  
  Today, I work with individuals and teams navigating moments of transition, ambiguity, or acceleration. The work often begins not with answers, but with orienting toward a clearer future state and restoring shared direction while operating in the present.
  
  ### Working Together
  
  From time to time, I work one-on-one or with small groups who find themselves at an inflection point. These conversations are not about quick fixes. They are about slowing down enough to surface what is shaping the system, clarify direction, and move forward with coherence.
  
  If that feels relevant, you are welcome to reach out and begin a conversation.
