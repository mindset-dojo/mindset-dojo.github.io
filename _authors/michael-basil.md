  ### Complexity Practitioner | Exploring the Edges and Gaps in High-Stakes Environments
  
  I never expected taming parrots and navigating soccer scrums to lead me into the world of identity and human systems. Looking back, it makes perfect sense.
  
  Growing up in my mom’s parrot shop, I learned early to sense tension, trust, and edge-states by calming unruly macaws through relaxation instead of force. On the soccer pitch, I learned how to move inside dynamic systems by reading patterns, shifting rhythm, and adjusting position to keep the field coherent.
  
  With a computer engineering degree from the University of Illinois, I carried that same pattern awareness into large-scale systems including identity innovation with a U.S. patent, DevSecOps modernization, enterprise software, and organizational transformation. Through this work I learned that the hardest problems in technology and leadership are rarely technical. They are complexity problems involving misaligned identities, unclear boundaries, incoherent roles, unspoken tension, and narratives that distort under load.
  
  Mindset Dojo emerged as an open-source human-systems project where we explore and harvest insights from edge spaces including nervous-system readiness, identity drift, relational gaps, and leadership under pressure. It serves as a laboratory for understanding how people and systems break, adapt, and realign.
  
  Today I operate at the intersection of digital identity and human identity where access, trust, and presence matter most. I work with individuals and teams navigating high-stakes environments where technical systems, human systems, and growth demands meet.
  
  If you are building something meaningful and find yourself at an inflection point where clarity, alignment, and coherent identity determine what becomes possible next, let’s talk.
