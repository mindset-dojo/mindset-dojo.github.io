  ### Leadership 🌱 Culture ☯ Technology
  
  I never expected taming parrots and navigating soccer scrums to lead me to
  coaching leaders—but looking back, it makes perfect sense.

  Growing up in my mom’s parrot shop, I learned early to read patterns of tension
  and trust—calming unruly macaws by relaxing into edge zones. On the soccer
  pitch, I found rhythm in motion, shifting fluidly between opportunistic striker
  and lockdown defender. Later, I trained for elegant simplicity with a computer
  engineering degree from the University of Illinois and spent my early career
  driving Agile and technology transformation across complex organizations.

  Through a series of deeply challenging personal and professional lessons, I came
  to see that trying to control everything—inside or out—was itself the obstacle.
  What once felt like strength revealed its limits. Letting go—and allowing for
  connection—became the real discipline. In that space, I began to understand the
  human experience—the invisible networks of emotion, energy, and attention that
  shape how we relate, decide, and lead.

  Mindset Dojo and the MetaShift Method emerged from that awareness—centering on
  conversational presence when it matters most, and meeting people at the depth
  required to bring real value.

  Over time, my technical lineage in computer engineering, enterprise software, and
  identity innovation (including a U.S. patent) integrated with this human-systems
  focus. What’s formed is a method for cultivating trust, precision, and agility
  across secure technical systems and human systems alike—equally applicable in
  code review, incident response, post-mortem reflection, organizational change,
  or difficult family conversations.

  I’m drawn to inflection points where technical complexity and human tension meet—
  where clarity becomes a competitive advantage. That includes helping early-stage
  startups, scaling leadership teams, and emerging talent stepping into their first
  leadership experiences—people hungry to learn fast, build well, and lead with
  presence.
