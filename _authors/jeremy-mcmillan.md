  ### Kyle Ingersoll: How I see Jeremy
  Jeremy has acted as a Senpai with Sensei Level wisdom in his domains of expertise (Aikido Black Belt, Philosophy, Math, Systems Thinking, Game Theory, and Site Reliability Engineer) while he was in the program.
  He has tested and guided me throughout my journey through the Program, and I have learned a lot from him. He was the Dojo's guide while we were walking The Way, and helped align our efforts to respect the lineage of prior Dojos.
  His centerness and commitment to the greater good inspires us all.
