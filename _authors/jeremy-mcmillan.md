about: |  
  Jeremy has been part of the Mindset Dojo lineage since its early days at SAP, where his presence helped reveal the deeper intention behind the Dojo — beyond pop-culture references and into the living spirit of Aikido, Zen, and disciplined growth. A black belt in Aikido and experienced Zen practitioner, Jeremy brings a rare synthesis of technical mastery and embodied wisdom to every circle he joins.
  
  A technologist, systems thinker, and security specialist, he bridges system reliability and human reliability, showing how both require calm under pressure, precise awareness, and trust in process. His influence quietly shaped the evolution from SAP Dojo to Mindset Dojo, helping define the cultural and energetic architecture that continues to guide the program today.
  
  As a co-author of the Circle Communities pattern within the InnerSource Commons Foundation, Jeremy has modeled what it means to cultivate ecosystems where knowledge, leadership, and care circulate freely. Across each phase of the Dojo’s development, he’s shown up as a calm, centered presence — often appearing at key training thresholds to support others in leveling up.
  
  Jeremy has helped many practitioners progress through training-level thresholds in both SAP Dojo and Mindset Dojo, including key program and project leaders such as Kyle Ingersoll. His steady mentorship, curiosity, and care have supported the growth of each member stepping into new levels of practice and leadership.
  
  Those who train with him recognize the depth of his energetic presence — a balance of technical precision, emotional steadiness, and an unwavering commitment to the greater good. His professional craft in security, risk, and reliability engineering reflects the same principles he embodies in the Dojo: clarity under pressure, discipline in motion, and service through wisdom.
  
  Jeremy’s leadership continues to inspire both the architecture and the attitude of Mindset Dojo: grounded, generous, and fiercely alive to The Way.
