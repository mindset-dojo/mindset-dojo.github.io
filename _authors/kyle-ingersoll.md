  ### Socio-Technical Engineer and Defender

  My interest in privacy in high school — and a growing suspicion of surveillance — pulled me toward **Linux** and the principles of **Free Software**. Early on I saw software as a place to defend individual agency: tools people can run, study, share, and modify. That seed convinced me that technical skill should serve freedom, not status.

  In **Community College** I stood at a fork: writing or computing. I still craved mastery over machines — and, I now recognize, the quiet power that comes with it — even if I didn’t want to admit that drive. I chose computer science and began an apprenticeship in craft and consequence: learning to make things that work, and slowly learning what it means when they don’t.

  Through **Reddit** I found **Cloud Security Office Hours**, a humble, helpful community, and was invited by Michael into **Mindset Dojo**. I didn’t connect with it immediately, but returning again and again — and learning from the Dojo and my Sensei — helped me fuse technical precision with conversational presence. Mindset Dojo became the brave space where writing returned and mastery shifted from being about me to being about the people I serve.

  Internships at **Richmond Community Schools** and the **Boys & Girls Club of Wayne County** turned ideas into practice. Protecting classroom and community networks taught me readiness and resilience — that each patch, policy, and pipeline is an act of care. Those experiences finished the arc: I moved from chasing prestige to treating design choices as moral responsibilities.

  Now I mix security, Free Software values, and conversational practice: building safe DevOps pipelines, enforcing automated quality gates, and writing Insight pieces — all toward one mission: to protect and expand human freedom through sociotechnical engineering. And yes — we have fun doing it. Zen-like discipline without joy is just a posture; the real practice is rigorous, kind, and, occasionally, delightfully playful. After all, what is a dream without resonance? A delusion.
