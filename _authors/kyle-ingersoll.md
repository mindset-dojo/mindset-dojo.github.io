  ### Socio-Technical Engineer

  My interest in privacy in high school ‚Äî and a growing suspicion of surveillance ‚Äî pulled me toward **Linux** and the principles of **Free Software**. Early on I saw software as a place to defend individual agency: tools people can run, study, share, and modify. That seed convinced me that technical skill should serve freedom, not status.

  In **Community College** I stood at a fork: writing or computing. I still craved mastery over machines ‚Äî and, I now recognize, the quiet power that comes with it ‚Äî even if I didn‚Äôt want to admit that drive. I chose computer science and began an apprenticeship in craft and consequence: learning to make things that work, and slowly learning what it means when they don‚Äôt.

  Through **Reddit** I found **Cloud Security Office Hours**, a humble, helpful community, and was invited by Michael into **Mindset Dojo**. I didn‚Äôt connect with it immediately, but returning again and again ‚Äî and learning from the Dojo and my Sensei ‚Äî helped me fuse technical precision with conversational presence. Mindset Dojo became the brave space where writing returned and mastery shifted from being about me to being about the people I serve.

  Internships at **Richmond Community Schools** and the **Boys & Girls Club of Wayne County** turned ideas into practice. Protecting classroom and community networks taught me readiness and resilience ‚Äî that each patch, policy, and pipeline is an act of care. Those experiences finished the arc: I moved from chasing prestige to treating design choices as moral responsibilities.

  Now I mix security, Free Software values, and conversational practice: building safe DevOps pipelines, enforcing automated quality gates, and writing Insight pieces ‚Äî all toward one mission: to protect and expand human freedom through sociotechnical engineering. And yes ‚Äî we have fun doing it. Zen-like discipline without joy is just a posture; the real practice is rigorous, kind, and, occasionally, delightfully playful. After all, what is a dream without resonance? A delusion.
